<P>
Mail
aliases are alternative names defined for an e-mail address
or a group of addresses. This window lets you add, change, or
delete aliases.
<P>
The system's mail transport program (e.g.
<CITE>sendmail</CITE>) may have a
list of aliases. Only your system administrator can change this
list.
<P>
In addition to the system alias list, you can define aliases within
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. These aliases are expanded to their full value before
being sent to the mail transport program.
<P>
When composing a message you can use aliases in the
<B>To:</B>,
<B>Cc:</B>, or
<B>Bcc:</B> fields. See
<A HREF="wmbqgMBPQJ9X3cS.html#0nbqgMBPQJ9X3cS">Header Fields</A> in the chapter entitled
<A HREF="Vj-1vFBulI9X3cS.html">Composition
Window</A> for more information.
<P>
Aliases are saved in files.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> looks for alias files in three
places:
<DL>
<DT>Your private alias file
<DD>This file, typically in your home directory, contains
aliases you define. You can modify this file with an editor
program, or use the
<A HREF="8lI1QLB-zWwA0YK.html#HlI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Aliases Window</A> in
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to make
your changes, as described below.

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>The default name of this file is
<CODE>$HOME/.mailrc</CODE>.
Alias definitions must conform to syntax
defined by the
<CITE>sendmail</CITE> program. (The easiest
way to ensure this is to make changes only
with the
<B>Aliases</B> window rather than with an
editor program). You can override the file
name by adding a
<CODE>mailrcFile</CODE> resource to your
<CODE>$HOME/.ishmailrc</CODE> file.
<HR>
</P>
<DT>Group alias file
<DD>Aliases shared by a group of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> users can be placed
in a common file. If your have permission to write to this
file you can use the
<B>Alias</B> window to modify it. The format
of the aliases is the same as your private alias file.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>The default name of this file is
<CODE>mailrc</CODE>, and the
default location is the
<CODE>lib</CODE> subdirectory of where
the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> program was installed. You can
override the file name by adding a
<CODE>groupMailrcFile</CODE> resource to your
<CODE>$HOME/.ishmailrc</CODE>
file.
<HR>
</P>
<DT>Other alias files
<DD><CITE>Ishmail</CITE> can understand alias definitions from other mail
programs, such as
<CITE>Z-Mail</CITE>,
<CITE>elm</CITE>, and
<CITE>pine</CITE>. You cannot,
however, modify these files with the
<B>Alias</B> window. If you
have other alias files, you can tell
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to use them by
adding an
<CODE>otherAliasFiles</CODE> resource to your
<CODE>$HOME/.ishmailrc</CODE>
file. For example:
<P>

<PRE>
otherAliasFiles: $HOME/.zmailrc $HOME/.elm/aliases.text

<H2><A NAME="G3J1QLB-zWwA0YK">Specifying Aliases</H2>

<P>
The
<B>Aliases</B> window shows the list of defined aliases in a box,
containing two text fields
- the
<B>Alias</B> name field and the name
field's associated
<B>Address</B> field. (If no aliases have been defined,
both fields are empty).

<P>
Each alias can have one or more addresses associated with it.
The address can be an e-mail address, another alias, or it can be
a comma-separated list of aliases or addresses.
<P>
Click the
<CODE>Sort Aliases</CODE> button in the upper left corner of the window
to cause the list to be sorted alphabetically. Otherwise, the list is
shown in the order that entries were added.
<P>
You use the four buttons to the left of the text fields to:
<UL>
<LI>Add a new alias.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Insert an alias into the list, above the selected entry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>This function is not available if you have
chosen to sort the list. In this case, new
aliases are always inserted in alphabetical
order.
<HR>
</P>
</LI>
<LI>Edit an existing alias.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Delete an existing alias.
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
E-mail addresses can have many possible formats. Here are four
that are commonly used:
<DL>
<DT><CODE>name</CODE>
<DD>This format is valid if
<CODE>name</CODE> is another user on your
system, or is an alias known to the mail transport
program (e.g. a
<CITE>sendmail</CITE> alias).
<P>

<DT><CODE>name@host</CODE>
<DD>This is the format used for Internet addresses (see
<A HREF="wmbqgMBPQJ9X3cS.html#pzDI2.BsKL9X3cS">Address Formats</A>.) The
<CODE>name</CODE> specifies a user on the
<B>host</B>
system. The
<CODE>host</CODE> may be a specific system name, or more
commonly, the name of a
<I>domain</I> (which is a group of
related systems). For example:
<CODE>support@ishmail.com</CODE>.

<P>

<DT><CODE>name@host (Real Name)</CODE>
<DD>The
<CODE>(Real Name)</CODE> is known as a comment. It is typically the
name of a person or organization. This information is
ignored by the mail transport system, but makes the
addresses more readable to humans. Comments can
appear anywhere in the address, not just to the right of
<CODE>name@host</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>Real Name &lt;name@host></CODE>
<DD>If this form is used, the
<CODE>Real Name</CODE> must appear on the left
and the
<CODE>name@host</CODE> must be enclosed in angle brackets. If
you edit the
<CODE>mailrc</CODE> file directly, you will see addresses of
this form enclosed in double quotes. You do not need to
use double quotes in the
<B>Alias Entry</B> window.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>CAUTION:</B>
<BR>The addresses you define must be either valid
alias names or valid e-mail addresses, or your
mail will bounce.

<HR>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>The Composition window has a
<A HREF="VvEI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Check
Addresses</A> function which can be used to see if
an address is valid. See the help card for the
Composition window for more details.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>The best way to create aliases is to cut and
paste e-mail addresses from actual mail you
received. Typing mistakes are avoided, and
you can be confident that the address is valid.

When you click the
<B>New ...</B>,
<B>Insert ...</B>, or

or modify an alias.

commas to separate multiple addresses, or put each address on a
