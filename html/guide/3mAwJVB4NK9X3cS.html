<P>
The procedure for
printing a message or messages containing
MIME-encoded inclusions or attachments is described below. As
you perform the print procedure, you can click the
<B>Cancel</B> button
at any time to cancel the operation, or click the
<B>Help</B> button to get
more information.
<P>
Click the
<U>P</U><B>rint</B> command to print messages either from the
Reading window or from the Main window. Inclusions and
attachments are printed separately from the original mail
message.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> has built-in support for printing the following file types:
<UL>
<LI>Plain ASCII text
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Rich Text
<P>

</LI>
<LI>PostScript.

<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In order for
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to print included or attached files containing
other MIME-encoded content types, such as GIF, JPEG, ODA,
and so forth, you must supply an external print application
command for each type and specify it in your
<SAMP>mailcap</SAMP> file or
<I>$HOME/.mailcap</I> file.
<P>
Before issuing a print command for any inclusion or attachment,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> checks the
<SAMP>mailcap</SAMP> file to see if a print command is
specified. If the command is found,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> displays the name of
the file in a
<B>Print MIME</B> dialog window along with selection prompts
that enable you to print the file or to skip it.

<P>
Follow this procedure to print messages containing inclusions or
attachments:
<OL>
<LI>Select the message(s) you want to print, then click the
<U>P</U><B>rint ...</B> option in the Main window
<U>F</U><B>ile</B> pull-down window.
The
<B>Print Message</B> window is displayed.

<P>

</LI>
</OL>

<LI>If the file is available locally, or if the file has
already been retrieved via a previous
<U>S</U><B>how</B>
option or
<U>R</U><B>etrieve ...</B> option (see
