<H2><A NAME="ZJI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Remove me from recipient list in replies</H2>

<P>
Toggle this parameter
<KBD>On</KBD> to have your name removed from the
recipient list when replying to a message that has your name in
the
<B>To:</B> field or the
<B>Cc:</B> field. This preference helps ensure that you
don't get a copy of your own reply.
<P>
Redundant replies can occur if you are listed in either the
<CODE>To:</CODE> or
<CODE>Cc:</CODE> fields of an incoming message.

<P>
In some cases, however, you may still generate an additional
reply copy. This could happen if your alias gets expanded to a full
Internet address. In that case, the pattern matching routine that
removes your alias from the recipient list will not be able to find
a match for the full address.


<H2><A NAME="CqFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Numbering Replies</H2>

<P>
When you reply to a message,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> and various other mail
tools change the original subject line by adding the prefix
<I>Re:</I>.
For example, when you reply to mail with the subject
<I>Question
about Ishmail</I> the subject in the reply will become
<I>Re: Question
about Ishmail</I>. If the reply is replied to, the subject becomes
<I>Re:
Re: Question about Ishmail</I>.
<P>
Toggle this parameter
<KBD>On</KBD> to cause
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to condense all
<I>Re:</I>
prefixes into a single prefix that is numbered to indicate how
many times replies have been traded on this subject. For
example, the
<I>Re: Re: Question about Ishmail</I> in the previous
example would become instead
<I>Re[2]: Question about Ishmail</I>.

<H2><A NAME="JqFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Remove comment text from addresses</H2>

<P>
E-mail addresses can be adorned with various information which
is ignored by the mail transport subsystem, but which make the
address more readable to humans. In
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, this extra
information is referred to as
<I>comment text</I>. Given the address
<KBD>support@ishmail.com</KBD>, here are two examples
containing comment text:
<PRE>
support@ishmail.com (Ishmail Technical Support)
</PRE>
<PRE>
Ishmail Technical Support &lt;support@ishmail.com>
</PRE>
<P>
In order to avoid cluttering the
<B>To:</B> field in the Composition
window, Ishmail strips off any comment text from addresses. You
can override this behavior by toggling this parameter
<KBD>Off</KBD>.

<H2><A NAME="1LI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Indent lines in responses using:</H2>

<P>
This field specifies the prefix to use for each line in the original
message of a reply. Any valid text string can be used.

<P>
The default character is a greater-than symbol (<SAMP>></SAMP>).

<H2><A NAME="VLI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Begin forwarded messages with:</H2>

<P>
This field specifies the string to include at the beginning of
forwarded messages. Any valid text string can be used.

<P>
The default string is:
<VAR>>>>>>Forwarded message from %from:</VAR>.

<H2><A NAME="cLI1QLB-zWwA0YK">End forwarded messages with:</H2>

<P>
This field specifies the string to include at the end of forwarded
messages. Any valid text string can be used.

<P>
The default string is:
<VAR>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;End forwarded message</VAR>.

<H2><A NAME="8LI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Attribution string:</H2>

<P>
This field specifies an
attribution string to use in message
responses.

<P>
The default string is
<VAR>%from:wrote:</VAR>, where
<VAR>%from:</VAR> is the
associated line from the mail header command through which
messages are filtered.
<P>
Any keyword found in the message header can be referred to as
a variable by preceding its name with a percent sign "%", for
example
<VAR>%to</VAR>,
<VAR>%subject</VAR>,
<VAR>%in-reply-to</VAR>. If the specified header is not
found in a particular mail message the variable name is used as
a literal. In other words, if the preference defines the attribution
string as
<VAR>$xyz said:</VAR> and an
<VAR>xyz:</VAR> line is not found in the message
header, the attribution string will literally be
<VAR>%xyz said:</VAR>.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Refer to
<CITE>RFC822</CITE> for a list of standard
keywords. If you wish to define new keywords,
follow the guidelines in
<CITE>RFC822</CITE>.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="iqFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Forward these headers:</H2>

<P>
In the
<A HREF="5MI1QLB-zWwA0YK.html">Displayed Headers Option</A> dialog you can specify which
mail headers should be shown in the Reading window. When you
forward a message, by clicking one of the
<B>Forward these headers:</B>
radio buttons you can specify whether the forwarded message
should contain:
<UL>
<LI>All the headers from the original message
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Only the headers displayed in the Reading window
<P>

</LI>
<LI>No mail headers
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="mqFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Signature Preferences</H2>

<P>
When you click the
<U>S</U><B>ignature ...</B> option, the
<B>Signature Preferences</B>
dialog appears.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="Y.FI2.BsKL9X3cS">Signature Preferences Window</H3>

<P>
Use the
<B>Signature Window Preferences</B> window to control how your
signature is used, if at all, in outgoing mail messages.
<P>
Your
<I>signature</I> consists of one or more lines of information, which
are added to your outgoing messages, typically at the end. You
can put information here such as your full name, street address,
telephone numbers, your organization's or company's name, and
so forth. Some people also put clever sayings, quotations, or
ASCII artwork in their signature.

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Internet etiquette encourages you to keep
your signature small, three lines or less.
<HR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="f.FI2.BsKL9X3cS">Signature files</H3>

<P>
You can have up to four different
signature files, for use in
different circumstances:
<DL>
<DT>Messages sent outside your organization or domain
<DD>The default path name is
<I>$HOME/.signature</I>. This is the
same path name used by various other e-mail tools. You
can use the same signature file with other tools.
<P>

<DT>MIME messages sent outside your domain
<DD>The default path name is
<I>$HOME/.signature</I>
<P>

<DT>Message sent internal to your domain
<DD>The default path name is
<I>$HOME/.signature</I>
<P>

<DT>MIME messages sent internal to your domain
<DD>The default path name is
<I>$HOME/.signature</I>
<P>

</DL>
<P>
If you do not specify any names for the internal signature files,
or if the names specified in the fields don't exist,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> uses your
external signature regardless of where the message is going. If
you don't have any signature files, no signature is added
regardless of the setting of the
<B>Add signature</B> button.
<P>
If your message is being sent to more than one person, and one
or more of them are external to your domain, the external
signature is used for all copies of the message.
<P>
Whether to use the enriched signature is controlled by the
<B>Signature Type</B> radio buttons.
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>If your signature file has execute permission
and you are the only one with write
permission, the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> uses your login shell to
execute the file and the standard output is
captured as your signature. This lets you
customize your signature for each message.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
You can edit your signature file by clicking the
<B>Edit</B> button to the
left of the file name. The editor specified as the
<B>Alternate Editor</B> in
the
<A HREF="XBFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Composition Window Preferences</A> dialog will be used (the
default is the
<B>vi</B> editor).

<H3><A NAME="2-FI2.BsKL9X3cS">Signature Type</H3>

<P>
Click the
<B>Always use plain signature</B> radio
button if you just want to
use the
<I>$HOME/.signature file</I>.
<P>
If you click
<B>Always use enriched signature</B> and your enriched signature
file exists, it will be used for all messages.
<P>
If you click
<B>Use enriched signature only in MIME messages</B> and your
enriched signature file exists, it will be used if you are sending a
MIME message. Otherwise, the plain signature is used.

<H3><A NAME="6-FI2.BsKL9X3cS">Add signature to outgoing messages</H3>

<P>
Toggle this parameter
<KBD>On</KBD> to cause
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to automatically add
your signature to every outgoing message.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>You can override this for an individual
message by toggling the
<B>Append Signature</B> button
at the bottom of the Composition window.
<HR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="9-FI2.BsKL9X3cS">Add delimiter before signature</H3>

<P>
Some mail tools always put a line containing two dash (minus
sign) characters in front of the signature. The MIME standard
does not include this convention, but it doesn't seem to preclude
it either. By default,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> does not do this but you can have this
extra line added by toggling this parameter
<KBD>On</KBD>.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Explicit help is available in the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B>
pull-down menu for each of the parameters
that can be customized. From the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B>
pull-down menu, select the
<U>O</U><B>n Context</B> function,
then move the cursor over the item of interest
and click the mouse.
