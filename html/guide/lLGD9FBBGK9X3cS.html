<H1><A NAME="lLGD9FBBGK9X3cS">Mouse Conventions</H1>

<P>
These
conventions assume you are using a standard
three-button mouse.

<P>
The left
mouse button (mouse button 1) is the most commonly
used button. You click the left mouse button to select items,
activate menus, and depress or release buttons within
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
windows. When a procedure asks you to "click on an object" or to
"select an item," use the left mouse button. The middle (mouse
button 2) is used for "drag-and-drop" operations (see below). The
right mouse button (mouse button 3) activates pop-up menus
associated with a particular object or item.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If your mouse has only two buttons, pressing
the left and right buttons simultaneously
should provide the function of the middle
button.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> windows follow
<CITE>Motif</CITE> conventions for selecting,
highlighting, and performing actions on selected items using the
mouse. Reverse image highlighting is used to indicate items that
have been selected.

<P>
In most cases, you will select (highlight) items, such as mail
messages, mail folders, alias names, and so forth, and then
perform some action on the selection(s).

<P>
There are several ways to select and then perform an action on
selected items.

<H2><A NAME="vE1fbLB-fH9X3cS">Selecting Items</H2>

<P>
You can
select single or multiple items:
<UL>
<LI>To select a single item in a list, place the mouse pointer
on the item and click the left mouse button.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>To select multiple contiguous items in a list (contiguous
items precede and/or follow each other in a list):
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Place the mouse pointer on the first item you
want to select and press and hold the left mouse
button. Continue holding down the mouse
button as you drag the pointer down (or up) the
list of items you want to select. Release the
mouse button on the last item you want to
select.
<P>
This is called the mouse
drag-select method.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Click on the first item and
<B>Shift-click</B> the last
item in the list you want to select.

<P>

</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>To select noncontiguous items in a list, hold down the
<B>Control</B> key and click the left mouse button on each item
you want to select. (Noncontiguous items can be
separated by one or more items in the list.)

<P>

</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="2F1fbLB-fH9X3cS">Performing an Action (command)</H2>

<P>
To perform an action on an item:
<UL>
<LI>Double-click the item (using the left mouse button).

<P>
Double-clicking an item performs the default action for
that item. For example, the default action for a
highlighted mail message in the Main window is "Read." Therefore, if you double-click a message in the Main
window, it will be opened and displayed in
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE>
Reading window.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Place the mouse pointer on the item and press and hold
the right mouse button. A pop-up menu appears that
contains a list of the valid actions you can perform on the
item. Slide the mouse pointer onto the action you want to
perform and release the mouse button.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Click the left mouse button on a pull-down menu in the
<B>Menu Bar</B> and select the action from the menu's list of
actions that can be performed on the item.

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Only the valid actions that can be performed
on the item will be available for selection. If
an option in the menu list is not valid for the
selected item, the option will appear "dim" and will not be available for selection.
<HR>
</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="PCzKjPB-VK9X3cS">Drag-and-Drop</H2>

<P>
You can use the
mouse
drag-and-drop method to perform certain
default actions on message(s).
<UL>
<LI>To drag-and-drop a mail message into a Reading window,
press and hold the middle mouse button on a mail
message and drag the mouse pointer into the Reading
window. Release the mouse button.

<P>
This action performs the same function as
double-clicking the message or selecting the message and
then choosing the
<B>Re</B><U>a</U><B>d</B> option from the
<U>M</U><B>essage</B>
pull-down menu.

<P>

</LI>
<LI>To
<B>move</B> a message to a folder using the drag-and-drop
method, press and hold the middle mouse button on a
message, then drag it to a mail folder icon and release.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>To
<B>copy</B> a message to a folder using the drag-and-drop
method, press and hold the middle mouse button on a
message and drag it to a mail folder icon. Press the
<B>Control</B> button, then release the mouse button.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>You can also perform the drag-and-drop action to move or
copy multiple selected messages to a folder icon. You
must first select the messages you want to
<B>move</B> or
<B>copy</B>, then press and hold the middle mouse button on
any one of the selected messages to move or copy all of
them.

<P>
If you drag-and-drop multiple messages into a Reading
window, only the first message will be placed in the
Reading window.
<P>
When items are being "dragged," the cursor takes one of
two different shapes. If the mouse is over an area where
"drop" is appropriate, the cursor takes the shape of a
"thumb up." If the drop action is not appropriate, the
cursor takes the shape of a "thumb down." 
<P>
