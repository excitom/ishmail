<H2><A NAME="rQc3vyBctI9X3cS">Folder Icons</H2>

<P>
By default, folder names are shown using icon labels. You can
choose to use smaller icons instead, so that more names can be
visible in the
<B>Open Folders</B> area without requiring scroll bars. Or,
you can choose to eliminate the icons altogether and just show
the folder names, which results in a very compact list of names.
<P>
Toggle
<KBD>Off</KBD> the
<B>Sort Folders</B> button to show folder icons in the order
they are opened. By default, this button is
<KBD>On</KBD> and folder icons are
sorted alphabetically by folder name.

<H2><A NAME="vQc3vyBctI9X3cS">Folder Type</H2>

<P>
When you create a new folder (see
<A HREF="f9tRqFB0aG9X3cS.html#LLY.bKBv3M9X3cS">Folder Menu Options</A>), you can
choose from one of three different formats for the folder. Your
choices are:
<DL>
<DT>UNIX (<CITE>mailx</CITE>-type)
<DD>This is the default on most UNIX systems. Your In-Box
folder most likely has this format. Each folder is a file
containing zero or more messages. Message boundaries
are marked by a line starting with the word "<KBD>From</KBD>" followed by a blank space.
<P>

<DT>MH-type
<DD>This is the folder type supported by the
<CITE>mh</CITE> program, and
related programs (<CITE>xmh</CITE>,
<CITE>exmh</CITE>, etc.). It is also to format for
<CITE>USENET</CITE> news groups. Each folder is a directory
containing zero or more files, each of which contains one
message.
<P>

<DT>MMDF-type
<DD>This is the folder type supported by the
<CITE>MMDF</CITE> program.
Similar to UNIX folders, each folder is a file containing
zero or more messages. The difference is that in
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>
folders the message boundary is a line containing four
<KBD>Ctrl-A</KBD> characters.
<P>

</DL>
<P>
All
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> functions work with each folder type. Which folder
type you select is determined mainly by compatibility with other
mail programs. For example, if you have been using
<CITE>xmh</CITE> and
want to switch to
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> you will most likely choose to work with
MH-style folders.
<P>
Toggle
<KBD>Off</KBD> the
<B>Confirm type before creating new folders</B> button if you
intend to always use the same folder type, and don't want to be
asked about it each time you create a folder.
<P>
This button is also found in the
<B>Confirmations</B> dialog (see
<A HREF="07--uyBk2I9X3cS.html">Confirmations Option</A>). You can set it either place.

<H2><A NAME="9Rc3vyBctI9X3cS">Showing Folder Names in File Selection
Dialogs</H2>

<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> uses a common
<B>File Selection</B> dialog for specifying file names
or folder names. It contains a list showing directory names and a
list showing file names.
<P>
When you use the
<B>File Selection</B> dialog to choose a folder name, the
names of MH folders appear in both lists. If you select an MH
folder name from the
<B>Directory Name</B> list, it is treated as a directory
rather than a folder. If you select an MH folder name from the
<B>File
Name List</B>, it is treated as a mail folder.

<P>
Showing the name in both lists can be confusing. If you are not
using MH folders, you may want to toggle
<KBD>Off</KBD> the
<B>Show MH folders
in file selection dialogs</B> button so that directory names will not appear
in the
<B>Folder Name</B> list.

<P>
Conversely, if you are using MH folders you may want to Toggle
<KBD>Off</KBD> the
<B>Show Unix and MMDF folders in file selection dialogs</B> folders button
so that only directory names (MH folder names) will appear in
the
<B>Folder Name list</B>.

<H2><A NAME="KRc3vyBctI9X3cS">Initial Folders</H2>

<P>
You can explicitly specify folders which should be automatically
opened when
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> starts up, by entering their names in the
<B>Initial Folders:</B> field.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>A
<KBD>+</KBD> character or an
<KBD>=</KBD> character at the
beginning of a name is a synonym for your
default folder directory, typically
<I>$HOME/Mail</I>.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, you can specify folders which should automatically
be opened when
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> starts up, by toggling
<KBD>ON</KBD> the
<B>Remember
folders on exit:</B> button. If you do so, any folders that are open at the
time you exit
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will be automatically opened the next time
you start the program.
