<P>
You can
customize
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE>
look and feel by means of the
standard methods for customizing
<CITE>X</CITE> resources. In addition to
command line options, resources tagged by the keyword
<SAMP>ishmail</SAMP> can be specified in one or more resource files. The
standard location for user-defined
resources is
<I>$HOME/.Xdefaults</I>.
If the
<CODE>$XAPPLRESDIR</CODE> environment variable is set it defines a
directory in which to look for a file called
<I>Ishmail</I>. Typically this
directory is
<I>$HOME/app-defaults</I>.

<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> preferences are stored in
<I>$HOME/.ishmailrc</I>. The syntax is
identical to that of the
<CITE>X</CITE> resources.

<P>
Mail aliases are stored in
<I>.mailrc</I> so that they can be shared with
ASCII mail readers.
<P>
Other
<CITE>X</CITE> resources can be stored in
<I>$HOME/.Xdefaults</I>,
<I>$HOME/app-defaults/Ishmail</I>, or in a file specified by
<CODE>$XUSERFILESEARCHPATH</CODE>.
<P>
See the <I>X User's Guide</I> for more information.
<P>
Frequently used resources can be customized from within
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. For example, you can make choices in
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE>
<U>O</U><B>ptions</B>
menus to customize a number of parameters and variables in
your
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> environment, including adding shortcut buttons,
changing the sort order of messages, adding icons, specifying
fonts, and so forth.

<P>
See
<A HREF="2EtRqFB0aG9X3cS.html">Using the Options Menu</A> for more information about
customizing
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> from within the program. See
<A HREF="Xj52wFBX4N9X3cS.html">Ishmail
Resources</A> for a more complete description of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> resources.
