<H1><A NAME="zOI0FGBvBJ9X3cS">Reading Window Components</H1>

<P>
The
Reading window is made up of these components:
<UL>
<LI>Main menu bar containing four pull-down menus that
enable you to perform tasks that are specific to the
Reading window.

<P>
You select options in these menus to read the next or
previous message, save or print the current message,
and reply to or forward the current message to other
recipient(s).

<P>
You can also select various options to customize your
Reading window environment, or click the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B> menu to
get more information about the task(s) you want to
perform.

<P>
For information about using the help menu system, see
<A HREF="DEtRqFB0aG9X3cS.html">Help Menu Options</A>.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Two subwindows or viewing areas that display message
headers and body text. These viewing areas can be
scrolled to display text that is outside the margins.

<P>
You can also specify the column margin of the Reading
window and elect to have text word-wrap if it is wider
than the specified margin.

<P>
A window resize button (called a sash in
<CITE>Motif</CITE>
terminology) on the right side of the Reading window for
changing the relative vertical sizes of the header viewing
area and the message body viewing area.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Pushpin icon for pinning the window to the screen (in
order to open additional Reading windows).

<P>

</LI>
<LI><B>View type:</B> radio buttons, which let you choose how to
format structured MIME messages.
<P>

</LI>
<LI><B>Wrap text</B> button, which lets you choose between wrapping
long lines to fit the window or using a horizontal scroll
bar.
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SbEZyyBMtM9X3cS">Reading MIME Messages</H2>

<P>
When reading a MIME message you can view it in
<I>Outline</I> form
or
<I>Flat</I> form. Chose which form you want by clicking one of the
<B>View type:</B> radio buttons. These buttons have no effect on an
ordinary mail message.
<P>
In Outline form you can easily see the message structure,
including nesting of parts, if any. Each part is labeled with a
description of its contents. You can click on any of the parts and
see it expanded.
<P>
How a message part is expanded depends on what it contains.
For example, to look at a PostScript part you must have a
PostScript viewer program on your system, such as
<CITE>ghostview</CITE>. To
look at a GIF or JPEG part you must have a viewer such as
<CITE>xv</CITE> or
<CITE>display</CITE>. To listen to an audio part your system must have audio
capability and a speaker. Plain ASCII text parts and Enriched
Text parts are shown directly in the Reading window.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Various viewer programs are
<I>not</I> part of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. If your system doesn't have the
appropriate viewer you won't be able to look
at certain attachments. However you can save
them to files, for later use, or include them in
subsequent mail messages to other users.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
If you choose Flat form to view a message all the plain text and
enriched text parts are expanded, or
<I>flattened</I>. The overall
structure of the message will not be as apparent, instead it will
read like a document rather than its table of contents.
<P>
In the Flat view, message parts containing data other than text
will appear as icons. The icon will represent the data type, and
will be labelled with a short description of the data. Just as with
the Outline view, click an icon and the appropriate view program
will be launched.
<P>
To save a message part to a file, position the mouse cursor over
the icon and press and hold the right mouse button. A menu will
pop up. The menu has an option for saving the MIME
attachment to a file.
<P>
For more information about viewing and printing MIME
messages, see
<A HREF="v.Q.uNBGxI9X3cS.html">Displaying MIME-encoded Messages</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Look at the
<CODE>mailcap</CODE> file, found in the
<CODE>lib</CODE>
subdirectory of where
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> is installed, to
see which viewing (and printing) programs
are associated with various MIME data types.
You can modify this file to use different viewer
programs.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="sUQ.uNBGxI9X3cS">Resizing the Reading Window</H2>

<P>
You can
resize the Reading window using your window
manager's resizing borders at the edges of the window. As you
resize the window vertically, the message body area grows or
shrinks proportionally while the header fields remain the same
size. As you resize the window horizontally, both areas grow or
shrink proportionally.
<P>
Vertical and horizontal scroll bars are available to scroll the text
outside the reading area.

<P>
There is also a
<B>Wrap text</B> button at the bottom of the window. If you
click this button
<KBD>On</KBD> lines of text will wrap at the right margin,
and you will not need a horizontal scroll bar.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>You will see different behavior of the text in
the Reading window depending on whether
word-wrap is selected and whether the
message contains
<I>hard newlines</I>.

<HR>
</P>
<P>
<I>Hard newlines</I> (sometimes referred to as
<I>carriage returns</I>) are
inserted into a message when the sender types the
<B>Return</B> or
<B>Enter</B> key when composing the message. Ideally, these are used
only to mark paragraph boundaries rather than the end of each
line. If hard newlines are at the end of each line, the message text
will not re-flow nicely when the Reading window is resized.
<P>
If word-wrapping is turned on and a message does not contain
hard newlines on each line, when you resize the window the text
re-flows to best fit the window.

<P>
If word wrapping is turned off and a message does not contain
hard newlines on each line, each paragraph will appear as a
single, very long line.
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>You may find that toggling the word-wrap
option improves the readability of a message,
depending on the mail tool which was used to
create the message. For example, the Sun
<CITE>mailtool</CITE> does not put hard newlines on each
line, but
<CITE>elm</CITE> does. Messages coming from
<CITE>mailtool</CITE> probably will look better with word
wrap enabled, while messages coming from
<CITE>elm</CITE> probably will look better with word wrap
disabled.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="wUQ.uNBGxI9X3cS">"Pinning" Windows to the Screen</H2>

<P>
You can have multiple
Reading windows open simultaneously.
Before opening each new window, click on the
pushpin in the
upper right-hand corner of the current window to "pin" that
window to the screen. Each time you open a new Reading
window, you can "pin" it, in turn, to the screen.

<P>
You can open one or more Reading windows at any time unless a
pop-up dialog is being displayed that requires action before it can
be dismissed.


<H2><A NAME="1VQ.uNBGxI9X3cS">Shortcut Buttons</H2>

<P>
Optionally, you can configure a number of shortcut buttons to be
displayed along the bottom of the or sides of the window. These
buttons help streamline your use of the window. There are more
than 25 possible menu functions in the Reading window menu
bar that can be performed by shortcut buttons. See
<A HREF="WPeSlNBpSL9X3cS.html">Shortcut
Buttons</A> for information about configuring shortcut buttons.
