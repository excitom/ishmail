Help facility that provides help
messages for all window and menu components. Seven types of
help information are available. The figure "Help Pull-down
Menu" shows the available

<P>
To get help while in the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> application, click the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B>
pull-down menu, then click on the appropriate help subject.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE> on-line Help system includes:
<UL>
<LI>QuickHelp messages in the message area of the window.
These pointer-sensitive hints help you understand the
purpose of the application and to use it more quickly and
efficiently.

<P>

</LI>
<LI>Help buttons for access to information on how to use
window features.

To choose an option in the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B> pull-down menu, either click on
the option, type its associated mnemonic (the underscored letter
in the option's name), or type its associated
<B>Shift-function</B> key
sequence.
<U>H</U><B>elp</B> menu options are:
<DL>
<DT><B>On</B>
<U>C</U><B>ontext</B>
<DD>Explains window components such as menus and
buttons. When you select
<B>On</B>
<U>C</U><B>ontext</B>, the pointer turns
into a question mark. To display the
<B>Help</B> message for a
specific component, place the question mark on the
component and click. A pop-up
<B>Help Card</B> appears with
concise information about the component and how to use
it.

<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>To see
<B>On</B>
<U>C</U><B>ontext</B> help for a menu option, first
select the menu then click on the dotted line
at the top of the menu. This "tears off" the
menu so it stays displayed. Now, go to the
<B>Help</B>
menu, select
<B>On</B>
<U>C</U><B>ontext</B>, bring the mouse
cursor back to the torn off menu, and click on
the option for which you want to see the Help
message.

Another kind of help, called
<B>QuickHelp</B>, is available for most
window and menu components. If
<B>QuickHelp</B> is available for the
current component, a terse description of the component under
the pointer appears in the message area near the bottom of the
window. As the pointer is moved into different components, the
quick help message is updated.
