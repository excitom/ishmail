<H1><A NAME="sHQXKNB0FN9X3cS">Modifying or Deleting an Included File</H1>

<P>
You can modify or delete both ASCII and non-ASCII included
files before executing a send option.


<H2><A NAME="tHQXKNB0FN9X3cS">ASCII Included File</H2>

<P>
There are two ways to include an ASCII text file. You can include
it
<I>directly</I> (the contents of the file are expanded into the text of
the Composition window) or you can include it
<I>separately</I> (with
an icon). To modify an ASCII text file included directly, simply
edit it in the Composition window.

<P>
To delete an ASCII text file included directly, select (highlight)
the text using the mouse button-drag-select method or a
keyboard selection method, then press the
<B>Delete</B> key or the
<B>Back
Space</B> key.
<P>
An ASCII text file included separately is modified or deleted
using the same procedure as that for a non-ASCII included file.

<H2><A NAME="wHQXKNB0FN9X3cS">Non-ASCII Included File</H2>

<P>
To modify a non-ASCII file, place the mouse pointer on the icon
and press and hold the right mouse button. A pop-up menu is
displayed that contains
<B>Edit</B>
<U>A</U><B>ttributes ...</B> and
<U>D</U><B>elete</B> buttons and
descriptive information about the file. Slide the mouse pointer
onto the
<B>Edit</B>
<U>A</U><B>ttributes ...</B> option and release the button. The
<B>Include/Attach file data</B> file dialog window for the file-type is
displayed. (Double-clicking the icon also brings up the
<B>Include/Attach file data</B> file dialog window.)
<P>
To delete a non-ASCII file, display the pop-up menu as described
in the
<B>Edit</B>
<U>A</U><B>ttributes ...</B> option above, then click the
<U>D</U><B>elete</B> button.
