<P>
To start
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> from the UNIX
command
line, type:
<PRE>
<B>ishmail</B> <KBD>[</KBD><VAR>standard_X_flags</VAR><KBD>] [</KBD><VAR>name1</VAR><KBD>[</KBD><VAR>name2</VAR> <VAR>... nameN</VAR><KBD>]] [</KBD><B>&amp;</B><KBD>]</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> accepts the standard
<CITE>X</CITE> client command line arguments.
Warning messages are displayed on the command line if
unrecognized option flags are used.

<DL>
<DT><VAR>X client option flags</VAR>
<DD>The standard
<CITE>X</CITE> client option flags as described in the
<CITE>X
User's Guide</CITE>. (Also see the
<CITE>X User's Reference</CITE> for
additional information about
<CITE>X</CITE> command line options.)
<P>

<DT><VAR>name1</VAR>,
<VAR>name2 ... nameN</VAR>
<DD>The names of the mail folders you wish to open during
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> startup. These names are relative to the directory
in which the command is being run. To make
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> look
for them in your folder directory, add "<KBD>+</KBD>" or "<KBD>=</KBD>" before the
name. Thus, the command:
<P>

<PRE>
<SAMP>ishmail +work +personal +projects</SAMP>
</PRE>automatically launches the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> application with the
default
<B>In-box</B>, or "system folder," as well as the folders
<I>work</I>,
<I>personal</I>, and
<I>projects</I> if their locations are relative to
<I>$HOME</I>.
<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<B>CAUTION:</B>
<BR>The program catches and ignores all signals,
except
<CODE>SIGHUP(1)</CODE>,
<CODE>SIGKILL(9),</CODE> and
<CODE>SIGTERM(15)</CODE>. If
a
<CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> is caught the program attempts to
save changes to mail folders, clean up, and
exit gracefully. A
<CODE>SIGTERM</CODE> works the same as
<CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>, except that changes to folders are
<I>not</I>
saved. If a
<CODE>SIGKILL</CODE> is caught the program exits
immediately.
<CODE>SIGKILL</CODE> should be used only as a
last resort for termination.

</P>
<P>
After
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> is launched, it appears as an icon on your desktop.
If you open the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> application and then iconify it, the
program remains active, showing one of three different icons, as
shown in
<A HREF="E-7NkEBPyK9X3cS.html#d-3fbLBahH9X3cS">Ishmail Icon Bitmaps</A>. The first, an icon depicting a
mailbox with its flag down, is displayed if there is no mail in the
In-box. When a new mail message arrives the icon changes to a
mailbox with its flag up, its door open, and newly arrived mail.
An audible alarm also sounds when new mail arrives. The third
icon, showing an empty open mail box, indicates there are no new
messages in the In-box though it may contain unread mail.
