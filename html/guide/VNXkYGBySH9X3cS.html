<P>
<B>ishmail</B> starts
<CITE>H&L Electronic Mail</CITE>, a graphical user interface
(GUI) to the
<CITE>sendmail</CITE> mail delivery subsystem. You can use
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to receive, read, compose, and organize electronic mail
messages containing standard 7-bit ASCII text information, as
well as the specially formatted information provided by MIME
(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension), including Rich Text,
audio, video, image (facsimile) and application information.
<P>
Interacting with mail objects in
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> is simple and intuitive. In
general, you select an object or multiple objects (mail folder, mail
message, alias name, and so forth), then select a command from
one of the menus to perform some action on the selected object
(<B>open</B>,
<B>close</B>,
<B>compose</B>,
<B>read</B>,
<B>reply</B>,
<B>forward</B>,
<B>resend</B>,
<B>save</B>,
<B>delete</B>,
<B>print</B>, and so forth).
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> has three primary window interfaces, the Main window,
the Composition window, and the Reading window. Each window
contains pull-down, tear-off, and cascading menus from which
you select options that perform various command functions in
the window.
<P>
The Main window is displayed upon startup. From the Main
window, you choose options to manage your mail folders and files,
read and compose mail messages, reply to, forward, and resend
messages, and customize your mail environment.

<P>
The Composition window is displayed when you select the
<B>compose</B>,
<B>reply</B>,
<B>forward</B>, or
<B>resend</B> command from the Main
window or from a Reading window. The Composition window
menus contain options for specifying an alternate editor,
previewing the formatted output of messages containing Rich
Text attributes, and including and attaching external files to
mail messages. You can have multiple Composition windows
open simultaneously.
<P>
The Reading window is displayed when you select the
<B>read</B>
command from the Main window. The Reading window menus
contain options for reading the next or previous message, saving
a message, printing a message, deleting a message, and other
functions. While in the Reading window, you can also display and
print MIME-encoded inclusions and attachments via external
viewing and printing software that
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> launches when you
select a MIME-encoded body part. You can "pin" multiple
Reading windows to the screen.

<P>
Each of
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE> primary windows contains an
<B>Options</B> menu in
which you specify parameters for customizing the "look and feel" of the particular window. Customization options include
changing display fonts and font sizes, adding shortcut buttons
for commonly performed functions, specifying sort parameters,
word-wrapping, and so forth.

<P>
<CITE>ishmail</CITE> accepts the standard
<CITE>X</CITE> client command line arguments.
Warning messages are displayed on the command line if
unrecognized option flags are used.

<DL>
<DT><VAR>X client option flags</VAR>
<DD>The standard
<CITE>X</CITE> client option flags. For more information
about these option flags, see the
<I>X User's Guide</I>. (See also
<CITE>X User's Reference</CITE> for additional information about
<CITE>X</CITE>
command line options.)
<P>

<DT><VAR>name1</VAR>,
<VAR>name2 ... nameN</VAR>
<DD>The names of the mail folders you wish to open during
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> startup. These names are relative to the directory
in which the command is being run. To make
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> look
for them in your folder directory, add `<KBD>+</KBD>' or `<KBD>=</KBD>' before the
name.

<P>
When the program starts, these folders and the default
In-box, or "system folder," are opened and presented in
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE> main window.
<P>

<DT><CODE>&amp;</CODE>
<DD>The standard flag to the UNIX shell indicating that the
program should run in the background.

<P>
<HR>
<B>CAUTION:</B>
<BR><CITE>Ishmail</CITE> catches and ignores all signals, except
<CODE>SIGKILL(9)</CODE> and
<CODE>SIGTERM(15)</CODE>. If a SIGTERM is
caught the program attempts to clean up and
exit gracefully. If a
<CODE>SIGKILL</CODE> is caught the
program exits immediately, losing un-saved
changes to mail folders.
<CODE>SIGKILL</CODE> should be used
only as a last resort for termination.
