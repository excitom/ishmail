<P>
The
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> menu options related to composing messages are:
<DL>
<DT><U>C</U><B>ompose</B>
<B>New ...</B>
<DD>Launches the Composition window, in which you
compose a new mail message. The Composition window
contains a subject field, recipient fields, and a
composition field in which to enter your message.

<P>
Some of the recipient fields-the
<CODE>Cc:</CODE> field,
<CODE>Bcc:</CODE> field, and
<CODE>Other headers</CODE> field, for example-are optional. You can add
or remove them from the Composition window using
options in the Composition window
<U>O</U><B>ptions</B> menu. (For
more information about using the Composition window,
see
<A HREF="Vj-1vFBulI9X3cS.html">Composition Window</A>.)

<P>

<DT><U>R</U><B>eply</B> ->
<DD>Replies to the current or selected message. When you
click the
<U>R</U><B>eply</B> option, a cascading menu appears from
which you choose one of four
reply options.

<P>
After selecting one of the reply options, the Composition
window appears, in which to compose your reply. After
sending your reply, the "<SAMP>></SAMP>" symbol appears in the Main
window status column next to the message indicating
that you have sent a reply.

<P>
The four reply options are:
<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>To sender</B>
<DD>Reply to the originator
of the message. Do not
include the original message.

<P>
This selection launches the Composition
window with the
<CODE>To:</CODE> field already filled in with
the address or alias of the message originator.
The
<CODE>Subject:</CODE> field is filled in with the subject line
of the original message, preceded by
<CODE>Re:</CODE>. The
composition field is blank.
<P>

<DT><B>To sender (include body)</B>
<DD>Reply to the originator
of the message and
include the original message body.
<P>
This selection launches the Composition
window with the
<CODE>To:</CODE> field already filled in with
the address or alias of the message originator.
The
<CODE>Subject:</CODE> field is filled in with the subject line
of the original message, preceded by
<CODE>Re:</CODE>. The
composition field contains the text of the
original message.
<P>
Optionally you can include an attribution line
and specify "<VAR>></VAR>" or other characters to delineate
the original text at the left margin. The
attribution line and delineation characters are
specified in the
<B>Reply/Forward Preferences</B> window.
(See
<A HREF="2EtRqFB0aG9X3cS.html#pdH1QLB-zWwA0YK">Options Menu Selections</A> for more
information about specifying preferences.)

<P>

<DT><B>To all</B>
<DD>Reply to the originator
of the message and to all
recipients of the message. Do not include the
original message body.

<P>
This selection launches the Composition
window with the
<B>To:</B> field already filled in with
the address or alias of the originator and other
recipients of the message. The
<CODE>Subject:</CODE> field is
filled in with the subject line of the original
message, preceded by
<CODE>Re:</CODE>. The
<B>Cc:</B> field is filled in
with the "copied" recipients of the original
message. The composition field is blank.
<P>
You can specify a preference in the
<B>Reply/Forward
Preferences</B> window to have your name removed
from the recipient list when replying to a
message that has your name in the
<B>To:</B> field or
the
<B>Cc:</B> field. This preference ensures that you
don't generate a redundant version of your
reply. (See
<A HREF="2EtRqFB0aG9X3cS.html#pdH1QLB-zWwA0YK">Options Menu Selections</A> for more
information about specifying preferences.)
<P>

<DT><B>To all (include body)</B>
<DD>Reply to the originator
and to all recipients of
the message and include the original message
body.

<P>
This selection is identical to the
<U>R</U><B>eply</B> -><B> To all</B>
option except that the composition field contains
the text of the original message.

<P>
Optionally you can also include an attribution
line and specify ">" or other characters to
delineate the original text at the left margin.
The attribution line and delineation characters
are specified in the
<B>Mail Preferences</B> window.

<P>
See
<A HREF="2EtRqFB0aG9X3cS.html#pdH1QLB-zWwA0YK">Options Menu Options Selections</A> for more
information about specifying preferences.

<P>

<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Replies that are generated using either of the
Reply
<CODE>To all</CODE> options are not sent to recipients
who were "copied" via the
<CODE>Bcc:</CODE> field by the
original sender because this information is
not available.

<HR>
</P>
</DL>
<DT><U>F</U><B>orward ...</B>
<DD>Forwards the current or selected message to other
recipients. Clicking the
<U>F</U><B>orward ...</B>
option opens the
Composition window. 
<P>
The
<CODE>Subject:</CODE> field is filled in with the
subject line of the original message, followed by
<CODE>(fwd)</CODE>. The
composition field contains the text of the original
message, delineated by demarcation strings that identify
it as a forwarded message. You must supply the recipient
address(es) or alias(es).

<P>
If you forward multiple messages, the first subject line is
used and each message is demarcated as a forwarded
message.

<P>
After forwarding a message, an "<SAMP>F</SAMP>" appears in the Main
window status column next to the message indicating
that you have forwarded the message.

<P>

<DT><B></B><U>F</U><B>orward (encapsulate) ...</B>
<DD>Forwards the current or selected message(s) to other
recipients. Unlike the
<U>F</U><B>orward ...</B>
option, the
<U>F</U><B>orward
(encapsulate) ...</B>
option keeps the message being forwarded
intact, as a separate MIME body part, rather than
making it part of the text of the new message.
<P>
Clicking
this option opens the Composition window. The
<CODE>Subject:</CODE>
field is filled in with the subject line of the original
message, followed by
<CODE>(fwd)</CODE>. You must supply the recipient
address(es) or alias(es). The composition field contains
an icon representing the message being forwarded. You
can type new text into the composition field, before or
after the icon. Also, you can click on the icon to open
another editing window, which lets you modify the
message being forwarded.

<P>
After forwarding a message, an "<SAMP>F</SAMP>" appears in the Main
window status column next to the message indicating
that you have forwarded the message.
<P>
If you select multiple messages to encapsulate and
forward, the messages are placed into a MIME message
digest. (See
<A HREF="07C1CfBrBM9X3cS.html#A9C1CfBrBM9X3cS">Working with Containers</A> for more
information about message digest containers.)
<P>

<DT><B>R</B><U>e</U><B>send</B>
<DD>Resends the current or selected message to a new
recipient. 
<P>
When you click
<B>R</B><U>e</U><B>send</B>, the Composition
window is launched. The
<CODE>To:</CODE> field is blank and the
<CODE>Subject:</CODE>
field is filled in with the subject line of the original
message.

<P>
The composition field contains the text of the original
message but the text is "dimmed" and cannot be edited.
You can view the text more clearly by clicking the
<U>P</U><B>review</B>
button in the Composition window
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down
menu.

<P>
After resending a message, a "<SAMP>B</SAMP>" appears in the Main
window status column next to the message indicating
that you have resent the message.
