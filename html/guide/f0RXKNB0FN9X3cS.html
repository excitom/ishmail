<P>
The
edit options are:
<DL>
<DT><U>U</U><B>ndelete</B>
<DD>Restore the most recently deleted text.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>This is not a full
<EM>undo</EM> option, since it does not
reverse the effect of format changes. Use the
<B>Plain</B> option to do this.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><U>P</U><B>lain</B>
<DD>Remove any formatting attributes applied to the selected
text.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If you have applied more than one format
change to the selected text, this option
removes them all. You must then reapply the
format attributes you wish to keep.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><U>B</U><B>old</B>
<DD>Click this option to apply the bold face attribute to the
selected text.
<P>

<DT><U>I</U><B>talic</B>
<DD>Click this option to apply the italic attribute to the
selected text.
<P>

<DT><U>F</U><B>ixed</B>
<DD>Click this option to switch the selected text to a fixed font
(that is, a mono-width, or non-proportional font).

<P>

<DT><U>U</U><B>nderline</B>
<DD>Click this option to underline the select text.
<P>

<DT><B>Bi</B><U>g</U><B>ger</B>
<DD>Click this option to increase the size of the selected text.
(Font size increments are governed by the font sizes
available on the recipient's system.)

<P>

<DT><B>S</B><U>m</U><B>aller</B>
<DD>Click this option to decrease the size of the selected text.
(Font size increments are governed by the font sizes
available on the recipient's system.)
<P>

<DT><U>J</U><B>ustify</B>
<B>Left</B>
<DD>Click this option to left-justify the selected text.
<P>

<DT><B>Jus</B><U>t</U><B>ify Right</B>
<DD>Click this option to right-justify the selected text.
<P>

<DT><B>Justify Bot</B><U>h</U>
<DD>Click this option to both left-justify and right-justify the
selected text, also known as
<EM>full justification</EM>.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>The
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> editor does not show full
justification, rather it looks like left
justification. But, the attribute is imbedded in
the message. Depending on the recipient's
mail tool, this may or may not be displayed
correctly.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> can print fully justified text
correctly.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><U>C</U><B>enter</B>
<DD>Click this option to center the selected text.
<P>

<DT><U>V</U><B>erbatim</B>
<DD>Click this option to mark that the selected text should be
displayed without any formatting, justification, word
wrapping, or indentation applied.
<P>

<DT><U>E</U><B>xcerpt More</B>
<DD>An
<EM>excerpt</EM> is a fragment of another message that you are
including in your composition. Typically, excerpts are
indented with some type of prefix character at the left
margin. Using the MIME
<KBD>excerpt</KBD> tag, a block of text
can be marked as an excerpt.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will show an excerpt
as indented text with a prefix character at the left
margin (see
<A HREF="uhFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Reply/Forward Preferences</A>) to define the
prefix for excerpts). The benefit of using the
<KBD>excerpt</KBD> tag
is that
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will automatically handle word wrapping
and justification within an excerpt, and also allow nested
excerpts.
<P>
Click this option to mark the selected block of text as an
excerpt. If the selected text is already within an excerpt,
its nesting level is increased.
<P>

<DT><B>E</B><U>x</U><B>cerpt Less</B>
<DD>Click this option to remove the
<B>excerpt</B> attribute from the
selected block of text. If the text contains nested
excerpts, the nesting level is decreased.
<P>

<DT><B>In</B><U>d</U><B>ent</B>
<B>Left More</B>
<DD>Click this option to indent the selected text from the left
margin. If the text is already indented, it will be indented
more. In the Composition window, the text is moved 32
pixels at a time. When the text is printed, the increment
is 36 points (.5 inch).
<P>

<DT><B>Indent</B>
<U>L</U><B>eft Less</B>
<DD>Click this option to remove one level of indenting from
the left margin. The change is applied to the selected
text. If already at the left margin, this option has no
effect.
<P>

<DT><B>Indent Right</B>
<U>M</U><B>ore</B>
<DD>Click this option to indent the selected text from the right
margin. If the text is already indented, it will be indented
more. In the Composition window, the text is moved 32
pixels at a time. When the text is printed, the increment
is 36 points (.5 inch).
<P>

<DT><B>Indent</B>
<U>R</U><B>ight Less</B>
<DD>Click this option to remove one level of indenting from
the right margin. The change is applied to the selected
text. If already at the right margin, this option has no
effect.

<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>The
<B>Superscript</B> and
<B>Subscript</B> options, supported
in earlier
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> versions, are no longer used
since they were dropped from the MIME
Enriched Text specification.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>The
<B>Character Set</B> option, supported in earlier
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> versions, has been removed. Instead,
use the
<A HREF="lQFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Outgoing Mail Preferences</A> option to
set the character set. Formerly, the character
set could be changed inside the message text
but this ability was dropped from the MIME
Enriched Text specification.
