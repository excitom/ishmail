<H1><A NAME="uO2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS">Using the File Selection Window</H1>

<P>
The
file selection window is used by several of
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE> pull-down
menu options that require you to select or type in the name of a
mail folder or a file. You can either enter in the name of a mail
folder or file in the file selection window text field, or you can
expand the window and select the desired name(s) from a list of
directories and files.
<P>
The file selection window is used when performing the following
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> tasks:
<UL>
<LI>Creating a new mail folder
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Selecting one or more existing mail folders to open
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Specifying a mail folder in which to save selected
messages
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Specifying a file in which to save selected messages
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Specifying a file in which to save a part of a MIME
message
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Specifying the name of an external attachment to a
message
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Specifying the name of an external file to include in a
message
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The file selection window is identified by a different title
depending on the option with which it is associated. For example,
if you invoke the file selection window via the
<U>N</U><B>ew ...</B> option from
the
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> pull-down window, it is called the
<B>Create New Folder</B>
window. However, if you invoke the file selection window from
the
<B>Sa</B><U>v</U><B>e </B>-><B> To </B><U>f</U><B>older</B> option in the
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down menu, it is
called the
<B>Select</B>
<B>Folder</B> window.
<P>
The functionality of the file selection window and the procedures
for using it also differ somewhat depending on the option that
invokes it.

<P>
The figures
<A HREF="uO2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS.html#9P2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS">File Selection Window</A> and
<A HREF="uO2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS.html#fR2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS">Expanded File Selection
Window</A> below depict the
<B>Select Folder</B> window and are intended as
examples for the purpose of describing how the window looks and
how it is used.
<P>
A "generic" description of the file selection window follows.


<H2><A NAME="7P2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS">File Selection Options</H2>

<P>
When you first invoke the file selection window, it appears as a
small dialog box that contains a text field in which you can enter
the name of a mail folder or a file.
<P>
The text that you enter will be processed by the command shell
(as specified by your
<CODE>$SHELL</CODE> environment variable), so you can
use pattern matching wildcards. In fact, you can even enter a
command if you enclose it in back quotes (`).

<P>
If the wildcard pattern or command matches more than one file
name, what happens next depends on what you're doing. For
example, if you're opening folders all the folders that match will
be opened. If you're doing something that only makes sense for a
single file, such as saving a message to a file, then the first file
name that matches will be used.
<P>

<P>
To the right of the text field is a
<B>Show list</B> button that you can click
to expand the window in order to see the current mail folder
directory (or your
<CODE>$HOME</CODE> directory, if you have invoked the
<B>Select
Folder</B> window via the
<U>I</U><B>nclude/Attach</B> -> option in the Composition
window). You can use this expanded file selection window to
navigate within your system's directory structure.

<P>
Click the
<B>Show list</B> button to expand the
<B>Select Folder</B> window.
<P>
The
<B>Create New Folder</B> window differs from the generic file selection
window in that it has three radio buttons which let you choose to
create a UNIX-type folder, an
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>-type folder, or an
<CITE>MH</CITE>-type
folder.
<P>
The
<B>Save Message to File</B> window differs from the generic file
selection window in that it has three radio buttons which let you
choose to save:
<UL>
<LI>All of the message headers along with the message body
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Only the headers shown in the Reading window along
with the message body
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Just the message body with no headers at all
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The expanded file selection window contains these additional
fields:
<DL>
<DT><B>Current Directory</B> field
<DD>The
<B>Current Directory</B> text field contains the name of the
current directory. To change to a different directory, type
another directory's name in the
<B>Current Directory</B> field and
press
<B>Return</B> or click the
<B>Set</B> button.
<P>

<DT><B>Directories</B> list
<DD>The
<B>Directories</B> list shows the names of subdirectories (that
you have permission to view) under the current directory.
To change to another directory in the list, double-click
that directory.

<P>

<DT><B>Folder Name Filter</B>/<B>File Name Filter</B> text field
<DD>The
<B>Folder Name Filter/File Name Filter</B> text field is a search
field. To search for a mail folder or file in the current
directory, type the mail folder name or filename (you can
use UNIX
<I>regular expression</I> patterns) and click the
<B>Filter</B>
button or press
<CODE>Return</CODE>. The names of mail folders or files
that match the search pattern are displayed in the
<B>Folders</B>
field.
<P>
There is a default pattern in the
<B>Filter</B> field:
<P>
<KBD>[^.]*</KBD>
<P>
This pattern excludes file names starting with a period
character.
<P>

<DT><B>Folders/Files</B> list
<DD>The
<B>Folders/Files</B> list contains the list of mail folders or files
in the current directory. To select a mail folder or file in
the list, click on its name.
<P>
<CITE>MH</CITE>-type folder names are shown with a slash (/) to the
right of the name.
<P>
To change the directory, enter the name of a different
directory in the
<B>Current Directory</B> text field (and press
<B>Return</B> or click the
<B>Set</B> button to activate the field), or
double-click on a directory in the
<B>Directories</B> list selection
field.
<P>

<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If you are working with
<CITE>MH</CITE>-type folders
(which are actually directories), their names
appear in
<I>both</I> the
<B>Directories</B> list and in the
<B>Folders</B> list. This allows nesting of the folders.
If you select an
<CITE>MH</CITE>-type folder from the
<B>Directories</B> list it will be opened and all the
messages in it will appear as folders (each
containing a single message) in the
<B>Folders</B> list.
This is one way you can use an
<CITE>MH</CITE>-type folder.
A different, and perhaps better way is to
select the name from the
<B>Folders</B> list. Then, all
the files in it are treated as messages in a
single folder.

<P>
To accept or apply your selection, click the appropriate button at
the bottom of the file selection window.


<H2><A NAME="UZ2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS">Accepting or Cancelling Your
Selection(s)</H2>

<P>
Use the row of buttons across the bottom of the dialog window to
accept or cancel your selections, or click the
<B>Help</B> button to get
more information. The button choices for accepting a selection
differ depending on which pull-down menu option you are using.

<P>
If you are working with the file selection window associated with
either the
<B>Sa</B><U>v</U><B>e</B> -> <B>To </B><U>f</U><B>older</B> option or the
<B>Sa</B><U>v</U><B>e</B> -> <B>To f</B><U>i</U><B>le</B> option in the
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down menu, click either the
<B>Copy</B> button or the
<B>Move</B>
button to accept your selection and close the window.
<P>
For all other file selection windows, click the
<B>Ok</B> button to accept
your selection(s) and close the window. Double-clicking the
selected mail folder or file also accepts your selection and closes
the window.

<P>
To cancel the select folder operation and close the window, click
the
<B>Cancel</B> button.


<H2><A NAME="TyG1QLB-zWwA0YK">Folder
Pop-up Menu Options</H2>

<P>
You can perform a subset of the
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> menu operations
-
<U>A</U><B>ctivate</B>
(make active),
<U>S</U><B>ave changes</B>, or
<U>C</U><B>lose</B>
- on any open mailbox folder
by selecting the corresponding option from an alternate pop-up
menu that you bring up adjacent to the folder.

<P>
Do this by placing the mouse pointer on the mailbox and clicking
the right mouse button (mouse button 3). A pop-up menu
appears from which you can select one of the valid options
available for the given mail folder. The pop-up menu contains the
name of the mail folder and the options that are currently valid
for that folder. Invalid options are dimmed. To select one of the
options, slide the mouse cursor down the menu and release it on
the option you wish to select.

<P>
The figure
<A HREF="uO2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS.html#nyG1QLB-zWwA0YK">Folder Pop-up Menu</A> illustrates this type of menu.
