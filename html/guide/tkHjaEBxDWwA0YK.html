<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> is a graphical user interface (GUI) for using Internet
electronic mail.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> is designed specifically for reading,
composing, and organizing electronic mail messages of varying
file-types, including:
<UL>
<LI>Standard mail (text messages containing information
encoded in 7-bit ASCII)

<P>

</LI>
<LI>Enriched text (text containing mixed fonts, point sizes,
and character attributes such as bold, italic, underline,
and so forth)
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Multi-media messages (messages containing
information encoded in one of the Content-Types
recognized by MIME):
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
See
<A HREF="v.Q.uNBGxI9X3cS.html">MIME-encoded Messages</A> for more information.

<P>
The
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> GUI is implemented using OSF
<CITE>Motif</CITE> and the
<CITE>X
Window System</CITE>, which provide for features such as pull-down
menus, pop up menus, tear-off menus, keyboard shortcuts, and
drag-and-drop. Also,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> has a distinctive "look and feel" common to
<CITE>Motif</CITE> applications.
<P>
The
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> GUI interface cannot be run in character mode.
However, the file format and directory naming conventions
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> uses for mail folders are compatible with common,
character mode mail interfaces, such as
<CITE>mailx</CITE>,
<CITE>elm, mh</CITE> and
<CITE>pine</CITE>.
Thus, you can use these alternative mail programs when
<CITE>Motif</CITE> is
not available-for example when you are logged in from home
using a
<CITE>tty</CITE> terminal.
