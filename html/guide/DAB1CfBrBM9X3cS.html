<P>
You can
resize the Composition window using your window
manager's resizing borders at the edges of the window. As you
resize the window vertically, the message composition area
grows or shrinks proportionally while the recipient fields, subject
field, and additional headers fields remain the same size. As you
resize the window horizontally, both areas grow or shrink
proportionally.
<P>
You can select the
<B>Wrap text at right margin</B> option in the
<A HREF="XBFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Composition
Window Preferences</A> dialog. When this option is in effect
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
automatically inserts a soft
newline character when you type
past the right margin. This causes the cursor to return to the left
margin and move down one line, so the text wraps around to the
next line as if you had typed the
<B>Return</B> (or
<B>Enter</B>) key. Soft
newlines differ from hard newlines, which are inserted when you
press
<B>Return</B> or
<B>Enter</B>, in that soft newlines move when you
resize the window. For example, if you type several lines of text
then resize the window, the text re-flows to best fit the new
window size.

<P>
By default, the
<B>Cc:</B>,
<B>Bcc:</B>,
<B>Fcc:</B>, and
<B>Additional headers</B> fields are not
displayed in the Composition window. You can select to display
them by clicking the
<B>Show</B>
<U>C</U><B>c:</B>,
<B>Show</B>
<U>B</U><B>cc:</B>,
<B>Show</B>
<U>F</U><B>cc:</B>, and
<B>Show</B>
<U>A</U><B>dditional:</B> buttons in the Composition window
<U>O</U><B>ptions</B> menu.

<H2><A NAME="rAB1CfBrBM9X3cS">Multiple Windows</H2>

<P>
You can
open one or more Composition windows from the Main
window at any time unless a pop-up dialog window is being
displayed that requires action before it can be dismissed.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
attempts to reuse existing Composition windows when possible.
For example, if you open a Composition window and type some
text into it, then select
<U>C</U><B>ompose New...</B> again, a new Composition
window is opened. However, if you had cleared the text in the
original Composition window, selecting
<U>C</U><B>ompose New...</B> would
cause the first window to be reused. The intention is to prevent
losing a composition in progress, while minimizing the number
of windows created.

<IMG SRC="DAB1CfBrBM9X3cS.extobj.1.gif">
<P>
Selection
buttons just below the message composition area
enable you to quickly customize messages you are currently
composing. See
<A HREF="lQFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Outgoing Mail Preferences</A>.

<H3><A NAME="vZJtg-BfiI9X3cS">Add Signature</H3>

<P>
The
<B>Add signature</B> option lets you to append a custom signature to
an outgoing message. If you toggle this button
<KBD>On</KBD>, the contents of
your
<I>signature file</I> is attached to the message prior to delivery. A
change to this button does not remain in effect after you close the
Composition window. The default value for
<B>Add signature</B> is
<KBD>Off</KBD>.
You can change the default value in the
<A HREF="uhFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html#mqFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Signature Preferences</A>
dialog.


<H3><A NAME="0aJtg-BfiI9X3cS">Wrap Text</H3>

<P>
The
<B>Wrap text</B> option specifies whether text should automatically
wrap when you type beyond the right margin. If text is not
wrapped, a horizontal scroll bar will be added to the window if
one or more lines in the message are longer than the window is
wide. A change to this button does not remain in effect after you
close the Composition window. The default value for
<B>Wrap text</B> is
<KBD>Off</KBD>. You can change the default value in the
<A HREF="XBFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Composition
Window Preferences</A> dialog.

<H3><A NAME="6aJtg-BfiI9X3cS">Check Addresses</H3>

<P>
The third selection button,
<B>Check addresses</B>, will cause
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to
request that the
<CITE>sendmail</CITE> program validate the address(es) you
typed into the
<B>To:</B>,
<B>Cc:</B>, or
<B>Bcc:</B> fields. A change to this button does
not remain in effect after you close the Composition window. The
default value for
<B>Check addresses</B> is
<KBD>Off</KBD>. You can change the
default value in the
<A HREF="lQFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Outgoing Mail Preferences</A> dialog.

<H3><A NAME="BaJtg-BfiI9X3cS">Message Type</H3>

<P>
Below the selection buttons are four radio buttons that control
whether your message is sent as a MIME message.
<DL>
<DT><B>Plain text</B>
<DD>Never send a MIME formatted message. Of course, this
option precludes the use of MIME features in your
message. Choose this option only if maximum backward
compatibility is your main concern.
<P>
If you include MIME features in a message, a prompt will
appear when you click the send option asking if you wish
to send the message as plain text even though
information will be lost.
<P>

<DT><B>MIME</B>
<DD>This is the default value. A message is sent as a
MIME-encoded message.
<P>

<DT><B>Both together</B>
<DD>Send the message in both plain text and MIME format
with the plain format first. Use this option if you don't
know the capabilities of your recipient's mail program or
if you are sending to several recipients, at least some of
whom have MIME capability. The MIME recipients will
not see the plain part, while the non-MIME recipients
will see the plain part first and instructions to ignore the
MIME part.

<P>

</DL>
<P>
Changes to these options do not remain in effect after you close
the Composition window. See
<A HREF="lQFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Outgoing Mail Preferences</A> to
change the default values of any of these options.
