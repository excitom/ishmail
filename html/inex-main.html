<h3>
May 1999
</h3>
<p>Ishmail is no longer being sold or supported.
H&L Software is closing down.
We will still offer Ishmail for download.
<hr>
<p>Version 1.3.4 is available for Linux, Sun Solaris 2.5.1, and HP-UX 10.20 systems. 
This version has the license manager disabled, 
so a license key
is no longer requried.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> (October 9,1999) Many people reported problems with Linux version 1.3.4. 
Since the only thing that changed was the license manager, 
I suspect problems with the build environment.
Anyway, the easiest thing to do was go back to version 1.3.3, which
is now packaged with a free permanent license key.
If you download now, this is the version you will get.
