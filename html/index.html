<p> Here is a <a href="html/who.html">list of some of the places where Ishmail is used</a>.
<h3>December 2015</h3>
<P>
I'm keeping this website around for sentimental and historical reasons.
It was the first website I built, in 1994. Ishmail was, I believe, the first
product offered for purchase and download on the Internet. At that time
software was distributed on CDs or floppy disks.</p>
<p>
We offered Ishmail as a 
free download with a built in license manager that kept track of how long
it had been installed. After the free trial period the customer needed to 
pay for a license key or the software stopped working. 
The concept of a license manager was not new, it was widely used to keep
people from buying one copy of software and letting others copy and use it 
for free, but I think we were the first people to use this technique for
downloaded software.
</p>
<p>
We accepted payment by mailing us a check or calling us and
giving us your credit card number. Online payment systems had not yet been
developed.
</p>

<p>
Ishmail source code has been sitting on SourceForge for a decade or so,
but SourceForge has some widely publicized problems so I decided to copy 
the source to GitHub. You can now find it at:
<a href="https://github.com/excitom/ishmail">https://github.com/excitom/ishmail</a>.
</p>
<h3>April 2002</h3>
<p>Wow, something new to report!
Ishmail lives on, 
supported by a group of dedicated users who have been making improvements
to the code.
Please check out what they've been doing at 
<a href=http://ishmail.sourceforge.net>http://ishmail.sourceforge.net</a>.
<h3>
May 1999
</h3>
<p>Ishmail is no longer being sold or supported.
H&L Software is closing down.
We will still offer Ishmail for download.
<hr>
<p>Version 1.3.4 is available for Linux, Sun Solaris 2.5.1, and HP-UX 10.20 systems. 
This version has the license manager disabled, 
so a license key
is no longer requried.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> (October 9,1999) Many people reported problems with Linux version 1.3.4. 
Since the only thing that changed was the license manager, 
I suspect problems with the build environment.
Anyway, the easiest thing to do was go back to version 1.3.3, which
is now packaged with a free permanent license key.
If you download now, this is the version you will get.
