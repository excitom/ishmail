You can download a demonstration version of 
<i>Ishmail</i> 
and install it on your system.
The program will let you read mail, but you will not be able to send mail or make changes to your mail folders.
If you want to 
<b>unlock the full capabilities</b> 
of the program, you can request a 
<i>30-day evaluation license</i>.
The license allows an unlimited number of people use the program during the evaluation period.
There is no obligation to purchase if you request the evaluation license.
At the end of 30 days, the license will expire.
<p>
Before downloading the program, you should read the
<a href="ftp://ftp.ishmail.com/pub/ishmail/README.license">evaluation license terms</a>.
