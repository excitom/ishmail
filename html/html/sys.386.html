Support for Novell UnixWare
</h1>
<p>
<i>Ishmail</i> is built and tested on <b>UnixWare 2.0</b>.
It is automatically integrated with the <b>UnixWare desktop</b>. 
<p>
Two types of packages are provided, a <b>tar</b> archive
and a package which can be installed
using the <b>pkgadd</b> command.
Select here for more
<a href="pkgtype.html">information on package types</a>.
<h2>UnixWare support is being discontinued</h2>
<p>
Considering that Novell has abandoned UnixWare,
and also considering lack of customer demand,
Ishmail support for UnixWare is being discontinued.
<p>
The current version is available on an "as-is" basis.
No further licenses will be sold.
