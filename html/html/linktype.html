<p>
<i>Ishmail</i> is built using the X and Motif libraries.  Some systems come
with these libraries and others don't.  For this reason <i>Ishmail</i> is
available with or without these libraries linked in with the application.
<p>
If you have both the X and Motif libraries on your system, download the
"shared Motif and X" (shmx) executable.
<p>
If you have the X but not the Motif libraries, download the "shared X" (shx)
executable.
<p>
If you have no X or Motif libraries, or if Ishmail will not run against your
libraries, download the "static" (stat) executable.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
Not all versions are available for all operating systems. You may not see
three choices.
