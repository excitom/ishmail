You may wish to install your demo copy of <i>Ishmail</i> as a private
copy.
Or, you may not have root privilege on your system, so you can't use
the system's installation commands.
Or, you want the quickest, easiest method of installation.
If any of these apply to you, then install the <b>tar archive</b>
version of <i>Ishmail</I>.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> There are some 
<a href="tar.html">drawbacks</a> to using the <b>tar</b> version.
<p>
If you want to use your operating system's "official" installation
command, you want your demo copy to be available to other users,
and you have root privilege on your system, then you should install
the <b>package</b> version of <i>Ishmail</i>. 
The specific command you will use depends on the
<a href="system.html">system type</a>.
