<p>Click a link to see a sample snapshot of Ishmail windows.
<h3>
<a href="../img/mainwin.gif">Main Window</a></h3>
<p>The main window shows a list of active folders at the top.
One of these folders is the <i>current</i> folder, 
and the list of messages in the current folder is shown in the bottom
half of the window.
<p>The folder area and message are are re-sizable.
You can change the ordering and contents of the columns as well as the ordering of the rows.
<p>You can also customize the buttons, and move them to different positions in the window.
<h3>
<a href="../img/readwin.gif">Reading Window</a></h3>
<p>Ishmail supports MIME <i>enriched text</i> so you can use different
fonts and styles.
<h3>
<a href="../img/readwin2.gif">Reading Window with Attachment</a></h3>
<p>You can attach files to messages, and attachments are shown in-line
in the text.
Click on an attachment's icon and the appropriate program is launched
to view it, save it, or print it.
<h3>
<a href="../img/sendwin.gif">Composition Window</a></h3>
<p>Ishmail's text editor is a <i>WYSIWYG</i> editor,
i.e. you can see the formatting changes to the text as they are typed.
<p>There are many shortcut keys for text editing,
and they can be customized to work like the <i>vi</i> editor or
like the <i>emacs</i> editor.
You can also click the <i>Editor</i> button to use an external text editor
to compose your message.

<h3>
<a href="../img/autofileprefwin.gif">Automatic Filing Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>Ishmail can recognize incoming messages, according to patterns you
specify, and automatically file the messages into folders.
Unix <i>regular expressions</i> can be used to define patterns.
Note that you can use a folder name like <i>/dev/null</i> to cause mail
to be automatically deleted.
<p>Similarly, you can define patterns for:
<ul>
<li>Running commands or programs automatically, to respond to or to process
incoming mail.
<li>Changing the Ishmail icon to indicate new mail has arrived, and use
different patterns to select different icons.
<li>Choosing which folder into which a message should be saved.
</ul>
<h3>
<a href="../img/buttonprefwin.gif">Button Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>For each main window you can define what buttons are show, what 
functions are performed, and what position the windows will occupy in the window.
<h3>
<a href="../img/confprefwin.gif">Confirmations Preference Window</a></h3>
<p>Ishmail is careful to ask you to confirm most operations, but you can 
selectively disable these.
<h3>
<a href="../img/findwin.gif">Search Window</a></h3>
<p>You can use complex logical patterns to search through messages,
either the headers or the body or both.
There is also a simple, case-insensitive string search function for folders
and inside individual messages.
<h3>
<a href="../img/folderprefwin.gif">Folder Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>Ishmail supports several different types of mail folder formats,
and you can use different types at the same time.
<p>This window also lets you control how folder names are displayed in the
<a href="../img/mainwin.gif">Main</a> window Folder List area.
Also, you can control which folders are opened at startup, either by
typing their names explicitly or by telling Ishmail to remember which folders
were in use when you exit so that these will be reopened the next time the program starts.
<h3>
<a href="../img/fontprefwin.gif">Font Selector Window</a></h3>
<p>You can define which fonts are used for text, buttons, lables, and
lists.
<h3>
<a href="../img/hdrprefwin.gif">Header Display Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>You can customize which mail headers are shown (or ignored) in the
Reading window.
<h3>
<a href="../img/mailprefwin.gif">Outgoing Mail Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>You can control many aspects of outgoing mail, such as character set, MIME encoding, and encoding for message headers.
<p>Also you can specify that outgoing messages be copied to a folder, and
there are several options for which folder is selected. 
For example, you can file outgoing messages according to the name of the
recipient.
<p>You can tell Ishmail to <i>confirm</i> certain addresses, 
for example to catch if you accidently include and <i>all company</i>
mail alias in your reply to a letter.
<p>You can add headers explicitly to each outgoing message, such as 
<i>Reply-To:</i>, or customize standard headers, such as <i>From:</i>.
If you turn on display of these additional headers in the 
<a href="../img/sendprefwin.gif">Composition Preferences</a> window, 
you can customize these headers on a per-message basis.
<p>You can control which command is used to deliver mail.
The default is to use <i>/usr/lib/sendmail</i>.
A Perl script called <i>customize.pl</i> is provided, which
gives you powerful capabilities to customize the headers of outgoing
messages. 
Refer to the <i>README.customize.pl</i> file, which is included
with the program, for more information.
<p>You can request that Ishmail <i>check</i> addresses by calling the
<i>sendmail</i> command to validate that mail is deliverable to all the
addresses.
<p>
<h3>
<a href="../img/messageprefwin.gif">Message List Preference Window</a></h3>
<p>This window lets you control how columns are show in the Message List
area of the 
<a href="../img/mainwin.gif">Main</a> window.
<p>You can control which columns are shown, in what order they are shown,
and the width of each column.
<p>In addition to giving columns a fixed width, you can resize columns in 
the Main window by clicking and dragging the column separator lines at
the top of each column.
<h3>
<a href="../img/readprefwin.gif">Reading Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>THis window lets you specify the default size of the
<a href="../img/readwin.gif">Reading</a> window, and whether text should
be automatically wrapped.
<p>You can also specify the web browser command if you use <i>CTRL-left-button-click</i> to click on a highlighted web page URL (address) in a
mail message.
<p>And, you can specify the commands to use for decrypting and authenticating
mail messages.
Default shell scripts are provided with Ishmail.
<h3>
<a href="../img/replyprefwin.gif">Reply/Forward Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>This window lets you set several options for how messages should be
formatted when you are replying or forwarding to another person.
For example, you can specify how excerpted text should be indented.
<p>Ishmail lets you keep track of a sequence of replies to a message by
numbering the <i>Re:</i> prefix in the subject. 
For example, the reply to a reply on the same subject is marked as 
<i>Re[2]:</i> and a reply to that reply is marked as <i>Re[3]:</i>.
You can disable this feature if you want.
<h3>
<a href="../img/saveprefwin.gif">Save Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>This window works similar to the 
<a href="../img/autofileprefwin.gif">Automatic Filing Preferences Window</a>,
letting you specify <i>regular expression</i> patterns to choose the
default folder name for saving messages.
<h3>
<a href="../img/sendprefwin.gif">Composition Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>This window lets you set several options for controlling how messages
are composed.
<p>You can set the default size of the window and whether text should
wrap automatically.
<p>You can set which header fields are shown, and which can be edited.
<p>You can set the shortcut key bindings to work like the <i>vi</i>
editor or like the <i>emacs</i> editor.
<p>You can set the names of commands to use for:
<ul>
<li>External text editor (default is <i>vi</i>)
<li>External spell checker (default is <i>ispell</i>)
<li>External commands for digitally signing and encrypting the message
</ul>
<h3>
<a href="../img/sigprefwin.gif">Signature Preferences Window</a></h3>
<p>This window lets you specify the path names of files to use as your
signature, depending on whether the outgoing message is in MIME format 
and whether MIME <i>enriched text</i> is used.
<h3>
<a href="../img/sortprefwin.gif">Message List Sort Window</a></h3>
<p>This window lets you set the sort order for the message list in the
<a href="../img/mainwin.gif">Main</a> window.
You can apply the sort order to:
<ul>
<li>The current folder
<li>Any folders selected in the Main window Folder area
<li>All folders
<li>As the default sort if no other sort order is specifically defined 
for a folder.
</ul>
<p>You can sort on any of the columns in the message list, and
a sequence of sort rules can be set for example, to sort first by
<i>Subject</i> then sort by <i>Sender</i> within subject.
You can sort in either ascending or descending order for each sort key.
<p>And you can sort messages by subject <i>thread</i>.
