<p>
If you install the <b>tar</b> archive, be aware of these limitations:
<ul>
<li>You (and other users) will need to use the full path name of the
program, since it will not be installed in a common place, such as
<i>/usr/bin</i>.
<li>You may see a warning message that you cannot lock your InBox folder.
If you see this, you will not be able to make changes to your InBox.
This is because the <i>Ishmail</i> program needs "set group ID" privilege
in the "mail" group, and setting this privilege requires root privilege
on your system.
</ul>
