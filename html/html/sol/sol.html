Solaris Installation Warnings
</h1>
<p>
The <tt>pkgadd</tt> command can generate various warning messages during
the installation.
Several warning messages are to be expected.
The first one will be:
<hr>
<pre>
The following files are already installed on the system and are being
used by another package:<br>
        /opt (attribute change only)
        /opt/ishmail (attribute change only)
        /usr (attribute change only)
        /usr/bin (attribute change only)
        /usr/share (attribute change only)
        /usr/share/man (attribute change only)
        /usr/share/man/man1 (attribute change only)

Do you want to install these conflicting files [y,n,?,q] n
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
To be safe, the package is explicitly specifying that common directories
should be installed.
Since these (most likely) already exist, you'll see the warning.
It doesn't matter if you install these files.
<p>
The next warning will be:
<hr>
<pre>
The following files are being installed with setuid and/or setgid
permissions or are overwriting files which are currently
setuid/setgid:
        /opt/ishmail/1.0.5/bin/ishmail.real <setgid mail>

Do you want to install these setuid/setgid files [y,n,?,q] y
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
The <i>Ishmail</i> program needs <i>setgid</i> privilege in the <i>mail</i>
group, so that it can coordinate update of mail folders with the system's
mail transport subsystem.
You should answer <b>y</b> to this question.
<p>
The next warning will be:
<hr>
<pre>
This package contains scripts which will be executed with super-user
permission during the process of installing this package.

Do you want to continue with the installation of this package [y,n,?] y
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
The package contains two scripts, called <tt>request</tt> and
<tt>postinstall</tt>,
which do some housekeeping during the installation.
The <tt>pkgadd</tt> command will run them with <i>root</i> privilege.
If you are suspicious about what these scripts will do,
use the <tt>pkgtrans</tt> command to extract the contents of the package
without actually installing it (and running the privileged scripts).
Then, look in the <tt>/var/spool/pkg/ishmail/install</tt> directory for the
<tt>request</tt> and <tt>postinstall</tt> scripts.
You may examine them to assure yourself that they will not abuse their
<i>root</i> privilege.
