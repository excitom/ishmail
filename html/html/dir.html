<p>
This is the directory into which the <i>Ishmail</i> package will be downloaded.
If you are installing the <b>tar</b> archive, this will also be where the
package is installed.
<p>
If you are using the <b>system-specific</b> package, you will most likely
install the package in a different directory.
In fact, the installation program may select the directory for you and not
give you a chance to change it.
<p>
This directory should have enough free 
<a href="/cgi-bin/comm/ishmail/size.pl">space</a> 
to contain the complete, uncompressed package.
