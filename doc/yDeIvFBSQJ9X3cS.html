<P>
All predefined
types and subtypes, as defined in
<A HREF="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1521.txt">Internet RFC
1521 (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension)</A>, will be handled by
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. The image, audio, video, and application types will not be
displayed directly by
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. Rather,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will rely on the
availability of other applications to do this. If defined in a mail
capabilities file (mailcap),
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will launch the specified
application when it comes across one of these types.
<P>
Also, two methods of data encoding will be directly supported by
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>; quoted-printable, and base64 (as defined in RFC 1521).
Briefly, quoted-printable is for character sets that are a superset
of US-ASCII, and encodes any 8-bit characters into a string of
7-bit characters. Base64 is used for parts that are largely (or
completely) 8 bit. This is superior to
<I>uuencode</I>, because it
guarantees that the encoded data will only be 1/3 larger than the
original. Another advantage is that Base64 does not rely on the
ASCII character set, therefore will decode correctly on a system
using, for example, EBCDIC character encoding. However, if a
user insists on using
<I>uuencode</I>, it is possible to define this
through the
<I>mailcap</I> file.
<P>

<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>The
<I>mailcap</I> file is a configuration file for
"mail capabilities," similar in style to the
more familiar BSD UNIX
<I>termcap</I> and
<I>printcap</I> files.

Following is an excerpt from the RFC, defining data types:
<P>
<I>Text</I> - Textual information. The primary subtype, "plain",
indicates plain unformatted text. No special software is required
to get the full meaning of the text, aside from support for the
indicated character set. Subtypes are to be used for enriched text
in forms where application software may enhance the
appearance of the text, but such software must not be required
in order to get the general idea of the content. Possible subtypes
thus include any readable word processor format. A very simple
and portable subtype, rich text, is the other predefined subtype.
The supported character sets will be US-ASCII and the
ISO-8859-* set.
<P>
<I>Multipart</I> - Data consisting of multiple parts of independent data
types. Four initial subtypes are defined; the primary "mixed" subtype, "alternative" for representing the same data in multiple
formats, "parallel" for parts intended to be viewed
simultaneously, and "digest" for multipart entities in which each
part is of type "message".
<P>
<I>Message</I> - An encapsulated message. A body of Content-Type
"message" is itself a fully formatted RFC 822 conforming
message which may contain its own different Content-Type
header field. The primary subtype is "rfc822". The "partial" subtype is defined for partial messages, to permit the fragmented
transmission of bodies that are thought to be too large to be
passed through mail transport facilities. Another subtype,
"External-body", is defined for specifying large bodies by
reference to an external data source (e.g. the MUA might use
anon-ftp to get the data for you).
<P>
<I>Image</I> - This format requires a display device (such as a
graphical display, a printer, or a FAX machine) to view the
information. Initial subtypes are defined for two widely-used
image formats,
<CITE>jpeg</CITE> and
<CITE>gif</CITE>. The viewer,
<CITE>xloadimage</CITE>, may be used
for
<CITE>gif</CITE>. The viewer,
<CITE>xv</CITE>, can display
<CITE>jpeg</CITE>, but this is not available
for resale. It may only be distributed as contributed software.
<P>
<I>Audio</I> - With initial subtype "basic". Audio requires an audio
output device (such as a speaker or a telephone) to "display" the
contents. The "basic" subtype is 8-bit ISDN u-law (PCM), and
assumes a 8k Hz sample rate on one channel. This will be the
standard audio device provided by HAL (same as Sun).
<P>
<I>Video</I> - This format requires the capability to display moving
images typically including specialized hardware and software.
The initial subtype is "mpeg". A public domain viewer called
"<CITE>mpeg_play</CITE>" is available for SunOS.
<P>
<I>Application</I> - Some other kind of data, typically either
un-interpreted binary data or information to be processed by a
mail-based application. The primary subtype, "octet-stream", is
to be used in the case of uninterpreted binary data, in which case
the simplest recommended action is to offer to write the
information into a file for the user. Two additional subtypes,
"ODA" and "PostScript", are defined for transporting ODA and
PostScript documents in bodies. At this time, and ODA viewer is
not defined.
<I>Ghostscript</I> is expected to be used as the PostScript
viewer. Other expected uses for "application" include
spreadsheets, data for mail-based scheduling systems, and
languages for "active" (computational) e-mail.
