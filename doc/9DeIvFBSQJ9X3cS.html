<P>
The figure,
<A HREF="9DeIvFBSQJ9X3cS.html#CDeIvFBSQJ9X3cS">Viewing a MIME-encoded message</A>, shows how a mail
message that contains
MIME information appears in the
Reading window.

<P>
Incoming mail encoded with MIME information is identified as
such in the message list in the Folder contents viewing area of
the Main window. The letter "M" is displayed to the right of the
message number. Also, if icons are enabled for the message list,
the icon will be colored with a rainbow hue versus plain white.
<P>
When a MIME message is selected for reading the Reading
window is presented. Message body parts containing plain ASCII
text or Rich Text are displayed directly in the Reading window.
Rich Text attributes, such as font changes, highlighting,
centering/justification/indentation, and so forth, are used to
modify the presentation of the text in the window.
<P>
Message body parts containing other data types are represented
in the Reading window with a box containing two buttons and
the description tag for the body part. The buttons are labeled
<B>Show</B> and
<B>Hide</B>. Pressing the
<B>Show</B> button causes the appropriate
viewer program to be launched to display the body part. Pressing
the
<B>Hide</B> button cancels the viewer.
<P>
There are two kinds of body parts, in-line and external. One way
to think of these is "copy by value" and "copy by reference," respectively. In the preceding figure, the second box shows an
external body part. It's a GIF file which can be accessed as a local
file (actually, it's a remote file accessed through NFS, but that's
transparent to the user), and the file's path name is given.
Pressing the
<B>Show</B> button will launch a GIF viewer to display this
file.
