<P>
The
<U>F</U><B>ile</B> pull-down menu contains options for sending comments
about
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to H&L Customer Support, printing messages, and
exiting from the program. To choose one of the options, either
click on the option, type its associated mnemonic (the
underscored letter in the option's name) or type its associated
<B>Ctrl</B>-key sequence.
<U>F</U><B>ile</B> menu options are:
<DL>
<DT><U>C</U><B>omment ...</B>
<DD>Generates a message to H&L Customer Support.
Selecting the
<U>C</U><B>omment ...</B> button causes the Comment on
Application window to open. The Comment on
Application window is a modified version of
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE>
standard Composition window. You use the Comment on
Application window to report a software bug or a
performance problem, request an enhancement, or
simply comment on the application. (See
<A HREF="p.oPvFBlqJ9X3cS.html">Comment on
Application</A>.)

<P>

<DT><U>P</U><B>rint ...</B>
<DD>Sends the selected message or group of messages to a
printer. The
<U>P</U><B>rint ...</B> option is selectable only if one or more
messages are currently selected in the
<B>Folder Contents</B>
viewing area.

<P>
Selecting the
<U>P</U><B>rint ...</B> button opens the
<B>Print Message</B> window
in which you specify how message headers are to be
handled. The options are:
<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Print all headers</B>
<DD>Select this option to print all headers including
headers that are normally hidden.
<P>

<DT><B>Print displayed headers only</B>
<DD>Select this option to print only the headers that
are displayed in the message header section.
<P>

<DT><B>Don't print headers</B>
<DD>Select this option to print just the body of the
message.
<P>

</DL>If you select multiple messages to print, two additional
options appear in the
<B>Print Message</B> window:

<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Print separately</B>
<DD>Select this option to print each message
individually (a print command is issued for each
message).
<P>

<DT><B>Print together</B>
<DD>Select this option to concatenate and print the
selected messages via a single print command.
<P>

</DL>After making your print selection(s):
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Click
<B>Print</B> to send the file to the printer.

<P>

</LI>
<LI>Click
<B>Cancel</B> to cancel the print operation and

<B>Print Message</B> window.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Click
<B>Help</B> for information about printing files.
<P>

</LI>
</UL>If the message contains MIME-encoded inclusions or
attachments, the
<B>Print MIME</B> dialog window is displayed.
You select options in this window to specify which
included files or attached files to print or to skip. See
<A HREF="3mAwJVB4NK9X3cS.html">Printing MIME Messages</A> for the detailed print
procedure.
<P>

<DT><U>S</U><B>leep</B>
<DD>Puts
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to "sleep" by saving changes to folders and
iconifying the Main window. You can use this option
when you are leaving your system but plan to read your
mail from another system. Using the
<U>S</U><B>leep</B> option will
prevent potential conflicts between changes to folders
you have made (but not yet saved) while in
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, and
changes you may make to the same folders with another
mail tool.
<P>
Selecting the
<U>S</U><B>leep</B> option opens the
<B>Save</B> confirmation
window, which asks if you wish to save any changes you
have made to mail folders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If you forget to exit
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> or put it to sleep
before going to another system, you can send
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> a
<CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal (<B>kill -1</B>) to cause it to
save changes and exit gracefully.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><U>Q</U><B>uit</B>
<DD>Quickly exit from the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> program, abandoning any
changes you have made to mail folders.
<P>

<DT><U>E</U><B>xit</B>
<DD>Gracefully exit the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> program, saving changes to
mail folders. Selecting
<U>E</U><B>xit</B> opens the
<B>Exit</B> confirmation
window. If you select the
<B>Yes</B> option in the
<B>Exit</B>
confirmation window, AND if you have made changes to
mail folders that have not yet been saved, the
<B>Save</B>
confirmation window appears, from which you can
choose to save or discard changes to the applicable mail
folders before exiting the program. Otherwise, the
program exits without saving your changes.
