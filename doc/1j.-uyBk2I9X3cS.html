<H1><A NAME="1j.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Application-related Preferences</H1>

<P>
Choose the
<B>A</B><U>p</U><B>plication ...</B> option to customize a number of
parameters and variables in your
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> environment, including
mail directory and file locations, print command, Web browser
command, and Alert bell volume.
<P>
The preferences that you can set with this option apply to the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> program in general or to the
<CODE>Main</CODE> window. There are
several other options for setting preferences specific to the
Reading window, the Composition window, and so forth.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>The decision about which parameter or
variable should be placed into which
preference window was made in a way that
seemed logical to the developers of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. If
you do not find a preference in the window you
expect, keep looking. You will find it
eventually.

<H2><A NAME="Yw.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Specifying Application Message
Preferences</H2>

<P>
This section describes the parameters you can specify in the
<B>Application Preferences</B> window. The name of each parameter is
shown, followed by a brief description of the parameter and an
explanation of how to set or change the parameter. Default
settings are provided where applicable.
<P>
Text fields scroll horizontally to accommodate text that is wider
than the field's margins.

<P>
You can accept the default information in a text field or enter
your own specification. The default text input editor for all text
fields is the standard
<CITE>Motif</CITE> text edit widget.

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Environment variables specified in the text
fields (such as
<CODE>$HOME</CODE>), are expanded before
being used. The tilde operator, for example,
<I>~username</I>, which specifies the home directory
associated with
<I>username</I>, is expanded if the
command shell specified by the
<CODE>$SHELL</CODE>
environment variable allows it.
<HR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="pw.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Check for new mail</H3>

<P>
This parameter sets the
interval at which mail should be
checked.

<P>
Enter a numerical value in this field if you wish to change the
default value shown.

<P>
The default value in the text field is derived from the
<CODE>$MAILCHECK</CODE>
environment variable. If this variable is not set, the default mail
checking interval is once every 60 seconds.

<H3><A NAME="0JI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Sound alert when new mail arrives</H3>

<P>
Toggle this parameter
<KBD>On</KBD> to cause a "beep" to
sound or to have an
<B>Alert</B> command executed each time new mail arrives (see
<A HREF="1j.-uyBk2I9X3cS.html#9j.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Application Preferences Window</A> for more information about
setting
<B>Alert</B> commands).

<P>
The default value for this parameter is
<KBD>On</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="zw.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Alert bell volume</H3>

<P>
Drag the slider left to reduce the volume, or drag to the right to
increase the volume.

<H3><A NAME="Ab23AUB4IG9X3cS">Scroll to new messages as they arrive</H3>

<P>
This parameter causes newly arrived messages to be scrolled
into view in your Main window message list.

<P>
The default value for this parameter is
<KBD>On</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="IJI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Hide messages marked for deletion</H3>

<P>
Toggle this parameter
<KBD>On</KBD> to cause messages that are marked for
deletion to be removed (or hidden) from the
<B>Folder Contents</B> list. You
can restore "hidden" messages that have been marked for
deletion by choosing the
<U>U</U><B>ndelete</B> -> <U>F</U><B>rom list ...</B> option from the
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down menu before performing a save operation to
the mail folder file.

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>The
<U>U</U><B>ndelete</B> -> <U>F</U><B>rom list ...</B> option is not
available in the
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down menu
unless the
<B>Hide messages marked for deletion</B> option
is in effect.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
If this parameter is toggled
<KBD>Off</KBD>, messages that have been
marked for deletion remain in the message list but are marked
with a
<B>D</B> flag. You can restore these messages by performing an
undelete operation before performing the next save operation to
the folder file.
<P>
The default value for this parameter is
<KBD>Off</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="6JI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Mark messages for deletion after saving</H3>

<P>
Toggle this parameter
<KBD>On</KBD> to cause messages to be marked for
deletion after you save them. If this parameter is in effect, when
you choose the
<B>Sa</B><U>v</U><B>e</B> option to save one or more messages, the
messages will be copied to the default save file (also specified in
the
<B>Mail Preferences</B> window) and will be deleted from the current
folder the next time you save changes to the folder.

<P>
The default value for this parameter is
<KBD>Off</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="Ex.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Mark New as Unread when folder is saved</H3>

<P>
This is the normal behavior of most mail programs. This option
lets you tell at a glance whether mail has arrived since the last
time you saved your folder (fresh mail is marked
<I>New</I>) and
whether your mail folder contains older messages that you still
haven't read (older, unread messages are marked as
<I>Unread</I>).

<P>
If you want messages to stay marked as
<I>New</I> until you read
them, regardless of whether the folder is saved, toggle this
button
<KBD>off</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="Ix.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Save window positions on exit</H3>

<P>
Toggle this button
<KBD>on</KBD> if you want
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to remember the
position and size of the
<CODE>Main</CODE>,
<CODE>Reading</CODE>, and
<CODE>Composition</CODE> windows.
These values are saved at the time you exit from
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>.
<P>
If you have more than one
<CODE>Reading</CODE> or
<CODE>Composition</CODE> window open, the
size and position of the first of these windows is saved.
<P>
The default value is
<KBD>off</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="4b23AUB4IG9X3cS">Show quick help</H3>

<P>
Toggle this parameter
<KBD>Off</KBD> if you don't want
quick help messages
to be displayed. Quick help messages are short helpful hints that
can facilitate your use of the window interface. They are
displayed at the bottom of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> windows.
<P>
The default value for
<B>Show Quick Help</B> is
<KBD>On</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="Rx.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Remember the most recent folders</H3>

<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> keeps a list of the most recently used folders, and
presents this list when you select the
<B>Save to Folder (Recent)</B> option
(see
<A HREF="dU8YifBdqH9X3cS.html">Save Options</A>). This gives you a quick way to pick folders
without having to type their name or use the
<A HREF="uO2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS.html">File Selection
Window</A> dialog.
<P>
The default value is
<KBD>10</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="Vx.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Move Read messages to folder when in-box is
saved</H3>

<P>
If you want messages you have read to be automatically moved
to another folder when you save the
<CODE>In-Box</CODE>, toggle this button
<KBD>on</KBD>.
This will result in only
<I>Unread</I> messages remaining in the
<CODE>In-Box</CODE>
after it is saved, since
<I>Deleted</I> messages are purged at this time
also.
<P>
If you toggle this button
<KBD>on</KBD>, you must also provide the name of a
folder to use. The default name is
<I>+mbox</I>. Note that the
<I>+</I> is
shorthand for your default folder directory.
<P>
The default value of this parameter is
<KBD>off</KBD>.

<H3><A NAME="HKI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Folder directory:</H3>

<P>
This field lets you specify the directory which is associated with
the
<I>+</I> or
<I>=</I> character at the start of a folder name.

<P>
You can specify a full path name, such as
<I>/u/dave/Mail</I>, or a
relative path name. Relative path names are resolved starting
from your home directory,
<I>$HOME</I>.

<P>
The default value is
<I>Mail</I>, thus the default folder directory is
<I>$HOME/Mail</I>. Therefore, a folder specified as
<I>+xyz</I> or
<I>=xyz</I> is
interpreted as
<I>$HOME/Mail/xyz</I>.

<H3><A NAME="NKI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Default save folder:</H3>

<P>
This parameter specifies which folder is used when you use the
<B>Save to: (default folder)</B> function on a message, or group of messages.
(See
<A HREF="dU8YifBdqH9X3cS.html">Save Options</A> for more information about message save
functions.)
<P>
Choices for the default folder are:
<DL>
<DT><B>Always to</B>
<DD>Specify the name of the default folder to be used with the
<B>Save to: (default folder)</B> function.
<P>
Click the
<B>Always to:</B> radio button and fill in the folder name
to activate this option. The default folder name is
<I>+mbox</I>.
<P>

<DT><B>By</B>
<DD>Specify the criteria that will determine the name of the
default folder to be used with the
<B>Save to: (default folder)</B>
function. Options are:
<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>User</B>
<DD>The folder name based on the name of the
person (<B>user</B>) who sent you the message. In this
case you also need to specify the directory which
contains the folder.
<P>
For example, if you choose this option and
specify
<I>Mail</I> as the directory, when you save mail
from
<KBD>support@ishmail.com</KBD> it will
be saved to
<I>$HOME/Mail/support</I>.
<P>
To select this option:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>Click the
<B>By</B> radio button
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Click the menu to the right of the
<B>By</B>
button and select
<KBD>User</KBD>
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Fill in the
<B>to directory:</B> field
<P>

</LI>
</OL>
<DT><B>Address</B>
<DD>The folder name is based on the full e-mail
<B>address</B> of the person who sent you the message.
This differs from the
<B>user</B> option in that the
<I>user</I>
name is qualified by the e-mail
<I>domain</I>. For
example, you might receive mail from two users
named
<KBD>tom</KBD> in different domains, say
<KBD>tom@ishmail.com</KBD> and
<KBD>tom@widget.co.uk</KBD>. If
you saved mail by
<B>user</B>, mail from both would go
to the same folder. Saving mail by
<B>address</B> would
put the mail into different folders:
<I>$HOME/Mail/tom@ishmail.com</I> and
<I>$HOME/Mail/tom@widget.co.uk</I>.
<P>
To select this option:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>Click the
<B>By</B> radio button
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Click the menu to the right of the
<B>By</B>
button and select

<P>

</LI>
<LI>Fill in the
<B>to directory:</B> field
<P>

</LI>
</OL>
<DT><B>Pattern</B>
<DD>The folder name is based on a pattern matched
in the headers of the mail message.

<P>

<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If the folder name associated with the pattern

is specified, then the directory name specified
here is ignored.

<HR>
</P>
<DT><B>Pattern or User</B>
<DD>The
<B>Save Patterns</B> are searched first for a match. If
found, the folder used is the one associated with

<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If the folder name generated by the

it will be created. The folder type is
determined by the default specified in the
<B>Folder Preferences</B> window. (See
<A HREF="6wXf7fBT.L9X3cS.html">Folder
Preferences Option</A> for more information
about specifying folder preferences.)
<HR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="Iy.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Automounter Prefix:</H3>

<P>
Some systems use a feature of NFS known as the
<B>automounter</B>.
If these terms don't mean anything to you, don't bother reading
this section and don't worry about this parameter. In most cases,
the presence of the
<B>automounter</B> is transparent to programs
such as
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>.

<P>
In some configurations, a special prefix will be added to
automounted path names. Say your home directory is
<I>/home/greg</I>,
and it is automounted. Using the
<B>pwd</B> command might return
<I>/tmp_mnt/home/greg</I>. The addition of the automounter prefix, in
this case
<I>/tmp_mnt</I>, can cause problems.
<P>
For example: If you attach a file to a message using the
<B>Local File
Attachment</B> option (see
<A HREF="bqbqgMBPQJ9X3cS.html">Include/Attach Option</A>), the automounter
prefix may be added to the path name. On other systems in your
network, the
<B>automounter</B> may not be used, or it may use a
different prefix. In either case, the path name of your attached
file may not be reachable unless the automounter prefix is first
stripped off.
<P>
This parameter lets you specify the automounter prefix, so that
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> can strip it off of file names before they are used. The
default value for this parameter is (on most systems) is
<I>/tmp_mnt</I>.
Check with your system administrator for more information.

<H3><A NAME="oKI1QLB-zWwA0YK">Default print command:</H3>

<P>
The
default print command is
<B>pr | lp</B>, which causes the message
to be formatted into pages, each with a running header
containing time and date, before sending it to the printer.
<P>
You can string multiple commands together in this field using
the UNIX
<B>pipe</B> operation, specified by a vertical bar (|) between
command names.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>This command is only used with plain text
messages. Printing of Enriched Text
messages, and any other type of printable
data contained in a MIME message, is
controlled by the
<I>mailcap</I> file. (See
<A HREF="6m52wFBX4N9X3cS.html">Mailcap File
Definition</A>.)
<HR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="Yy.-uyBk2I9X3cS">Web browser
command:</H3>

<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> automatically recognizes addresses on the World Wide
Web (known as URLs) which may be contained in mail messages,
and highlights them in a different font or color. When you place
the cursor on a URL and press the left mouse button while
holding down the
<KBD>Ctrl</KBD> key, the URL is sent to a Web browser
command which will display the associated Web page.
<P>
This parameter lets you
specify the Web browser command.
Relative path names are resolved using your
<I>$PATH</I> environment
variable. The value of the URL is substituted for
<KBD>%s</KBD>.
<P>
The default Web browser command is:
<B>Mosaic %s</B>
