<P>
You must have a
license to use
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. Anyone can have a 30-day
free license to
evaluate the product. Here's how to obtain an
evaluation license.


<H2><A NAME="bG3a7fB9yL9X3cS">Requesting an Evaluation License</H2>

<P>
When you first install and start
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> you will see the
<A HREF="ZG3a7fB9yL9X3cS.html#rG3a7fB9yL9X3cS">Ishmail
License Request Window</A>. It will have your e-mail address and
your system's IP address already filled in, though you can
override this information. Please make sure your e-mail address
is correct, then press the
<B>Request License</B> button and e-mail will be
sent to
<SAMP>support@ishmail.com</SAMP>, requesting an evaluation
license.
<P>
Within hours (Monday through Friday, 8am to 6pm CST), you
will receive an e-mail message containing your evaluation
license. In the interim, you can read mail and explore many of
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE> features, but you cannot send or print mail, nor save
changes to your mail folders.
<P>
An exception to the restriction against sending new mail is the
<B>Comment ...</B> feature, available in the
<B>File</B> menu. Click the
<B>Comment ...</B>
button in the
<B>File</B> menu to display the Comment on Application
window. You can use this window to experiment with composing
mail messages or to send us questions and comments. However,
the
<B>To:</B> address is permanently set to
<SAMP>support@ishmail.com</SAMP>.
<P>
When you receive the license message, it will include a file. This
file must be saved in the
<SAMP>bin</SAMP> sub-directory of the location where
you installed
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. The easiest way to do this is to move the
mouse cursor over the file's icon, then press and hold the right
button. A menu will pop up. Choose the
<B>Save</B> option. Next, a
window will pop up with the default location of the license file
already filled in. If you installed
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> in a different location
you must change this pathname.

<P>
There are three types of licenses. You can license an unlimited
number of users at your site, you can license a list of specific
users, or you can license a particular machine.
<P>
If you want to license a list of specific users, you tell us the total
number of users when you request your license. Each time a
different person uses
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, their login name is added to the list
of users. When the maximum number of users is reached anyone
else who tries to use
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will see the

Exceeded Window</A>.

<P>
If you want to add more users to your license, contact us by
telephone or e-mail. If you want to remove users from the list to
make room for other users, you can edit the license file and delete
one or more names.

<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>The license file is called
<I>license</I> and is located
in the
<I>bin</I> sub-directory of where
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> is
installed. It has several lines at the beginning
containing license information, followed by a
list of user names, one name per line.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<B>WARNING:</B>
<BR>Do not attempt to edit anything in the license
file other than the list of user names. To do so
will corrupt the license file and make it
unusable.
