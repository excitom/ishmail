<P>
When you click the
<U>M</U><B>ail ...</B> option, the
<B>Outgoing Mail Preferences</B> dialog
appears.

<P>
The
<B>Outgoing Mail Preferences</B> window lets you specify how messages
are encoded, into which folders mail is copied when sent, which
mail delivery command to use, whether to validate addresses
before use, and handling of extremely large messages.
<P>
Explicit help is available in the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B> pull-down menu for each of
the parameters that can be customized. From the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B> pull-down
menu, select the
<U>O</U><B>n Context</B> function, then move the cursor over
the item of interest and click the mouse.

<H2><A NAME="cfFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Encoding</H2>

<P>
Since
MIME messages ultimately encode all data as plain ASCII
text, MIME-formatted messages can be read using any mail tool.
However, the data format may not be very readable. The
<B>Outgoing
mail</B> type option lets you enhance MIME message readability for
people using non-MIME tools. There four options. The option you
set in the
<B>Outgoing Mail Preferences</B> dialog becomes the default.

<DL>
<DT><B>Plain text</B>
<DD>The message is sent with all MIME formatting and
attachments stripped from it. This is the ultimate in
backward compatibility though, of course, you lose all the
advanced MIME features.
<P>

<DT><B>MIME</B>
<DD>The message is sent as a MIME message.
<P>

<DT><B>MIME with plain text alternative if necessary</B>
<DD>Similar to the
<B>MIME</B> option, the message is sent as plain
text unless it needs MIME formatting. It differs in that a
<I>plain text alternative</I> is included in front of a MIME
message. The plain text alternative is the message text
with all MIME attributes stripped, like the
<B>Plain text</B>
option. Recipients without MIME-capability will see the
plain text alternative, and can ignore the following copy
of the message with encoded MIME data. MIME-capable
mail tools will automatically skip the plain text
alternative part and utilize the MIME encoded data. So,
this is the best of both, allowing maximum backward
compatibility while not losing MIME capability.
However, the message can be much larger, up to double
the size, due to the duplicate copies of the message in
different formats.
<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>You can override the default encoding option
by resetting its value in the
<B>Message type:</B>
selection box at the bottom of the composition
window.

<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="yfFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Character set</H2>

<P>
You can specify the character set that will be used to display the
message. The
<B>ISO-8859</B> character sets are supported. You can type
the name of a character set into the field, or click the button to
the right of the field and pick a character set from the resulting
pop-up list.
<P>
Changing the character set has two effects. First, it changes how
the text appears in the Composition window. Second, a character
set parameter is added to the message when it is sent. If this
parameter is recognized and handled by the recipient's mail tool,
your message should appear as you typed it. There's no
guarantee, however, that the recipient's system will have the
appropriate fonts installed to show the character set you have
chosen.
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR><CITE>Ishmail</CITE> supports MIME
<I>RFC 1522</I>, which
means that 8-bit ASCII characters can be
used in message headers. The character set
you choose here applies to the headers
(<B>Subject:</B>,
<B>To:</B>, etc.) as well as the message body.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="4gFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Encoding for 8-bit characters</H2>

<P>
For compatibility with all mail transport systems, use of
character sets in mail messages, as they are sent over the
network, must be limited to 7-bit ASCII. This is true even if both
the sender and recipient have no trouble with 8-bit characters,
since an intermediate network through which the message
passes on its way to its destination may have a limitation of 7-bit
characters. The MIME standard provides several methods for
encoding data so that it appears, while in transit, as 7-bit ASCII.

<P>
In this window, you can specify which encoding option to use for
8-bit characters in the message body, and potentially a different
encoding option for 8-bit characters in the headers. The choices
for the body are:
<UL>
<LI>Mark as containing 8-bit ASCII characters
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Convert to 7-bit ASCII using the Quoted Printable
method
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The choices for the headers are:
<UL>
<LI>No encoding at all
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Convert to 7-bit ASCII using the Quoted Printable
method
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Convert to 7-bit ASCII using the Base 64 method
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>The choices for each are not exactly the same,
since the standards specifications were
developed by different people at different
times.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="DgFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Copy outgoing messages</H2>

<P>
You can have messages copied automatically to a folder at the
time they are sent. You can use the same folder each time, or
specify a folder name based on one of the following:
<DL>
<DT><B>User</B>
<DD>The folder name will be the recipient's user name, as
specified in the
<B>To:</B> field. If there are multiple names in
the
<B>To:</B> field, the message is copied to multiple folders (the
<B>Cc:</B> and
<B>Bcc:</B> fields are not included). For example, if you
send mail to
<KBD>greg@ishmail.com</KBD>, the message will be
copied to the folder called
<I>greg</I>.
<P>

<DT><B>Address</B>
<DD>This is similar to the
<B>User</B> option, except that the folder
name is the whole e-mail address. For example, if you
send mail to
<KBD>greg@ishmail.com</KBD>, the message will be
copied to the folder called
<I>greg@ishmail.com</I>. This is useful
if you correspond with people in different organizations
who have the same user name.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>You can use links (the UNIX
<B>ln</B> command) to
give alias names to folders. For example, you
may want to make
<I>greg</I> and
<I>greg@ishmail.com</I> be
the same folder, while
<I>greg@osf.org</I> is a
different folder.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><B>Year</B>
<DD>Use this option to group outgoing mail by year. The folder
name will be
<I>year.[year]</I>, for example,
<I>year.1995</I>.
<P>

<DT><B>Month</B>
<DD>Use this option to group outgoing mail by month. The
folder name will be
<I>month.[year].[01-12]</I>, for example,
<I>month.1995.05</I>.
<P>

<DT><B>Day</B>
<DD>Use this option to group outgoing mail by day of the
month. The folder name will be
<I>day.[year].[01-12].[01-31]</I>,
for example,
<I>day.1995.05.30</I>.
<P>

<DT><B>Week</B>
<DD>Use this option to group outgoing mail by week in the
year. The folder name will be
<I>week.[year].[01-52]</I>, for
example,
<I>week.1995.21</I>.
<P>

</DL>
<P>
If you want to use the same folder each time, you specify the
name of that folder. Note that if the first character of the folder
name is a
<KBD>+</KBD> or an
<KBD>=</KBD>, this is substituted with the name of your
folder directory (as specified in the
<A HREF="1j.-uyBk2I9X3cS.html">Application-related
Preferences</A> dialog), which is typically
<I>$HOME/Mail</I>.
<P>
If you specify the folder name as a variable, you also need to
specify the folder directory. This can be a full path name or a
name relative to your home directory.


<H2><A NAME="zgFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Confirm use of mail addresses</H2>

<P>
Sometimes mail is sent that includes a
<B>Cc:</B> to a mail alias
containing a large number of recipients, such as your entire
organization. You may reply to such a message, intending only to
send mail to the originator, but inadvertently select
<B>Reply All:</B>. This
causes you reply to be broadcast to a much wider audience than
you intended. To guard against this kind of embarrassment, you
can specify mail aliases, which if used, cause a confirmation
prompt to be shown.
<P>
Type the names of mail aliases you want to be careful about
using into the
<B>Confirm mail to these addresses</B> field. The field will show
a vertical scroll bar if you enter more lines than fit in the field.
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>Another use for this field is to catch common
typing mistakes. For example, if you find that
you tend to reverse two letters in a mail
address you frequently use, put the
misspelled address in this field.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="4hFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Additional mail headers</H2>

<P>
You may want to add extra mail headers to your mail message,
for example:
<UL>
<LI><B>Reply-To:</B>
<P>

</LI>
<LI><B>Organization:</B>
<P>

</LI>
<LI><B>X-Face:</B>
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Any mail headers you enter into this field will be included in
every subsequent message you send.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR><CITE>Ishmail</CITE> doesn't check the validity of
information you specify here. You are
responsible for using valid header names and
spelling them correctly.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="AhFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Mail delivery command</H2>

<P>
This is the name of the mail transport command
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> uses to
send mail. The default is the
<B>sendmail</B> command. You may want
to use a different command. Or, the
<B>sendmail</B> command may be
in a different directory on your system, and you just need to
change the path name.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> passes two parameters to the
<B>sendmail</B> command:
<KBD>-oi</KBD>
and
<KBD>-oem.</KBD> If the message is being sent in multiple pieces, the
<KBD>-odi</KBD> parameter is added also.
<P>
After the parameters the recipients' addresses are added, each
enclosed in single quote characters. This allows addresses to
have embedded double quotes and blanks (spaces).
<P>
After the addresses, a
<KBD>&lt;</KBD> symbol is added followed by the path
name of a temporary file which holds the complete message.
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>If you want to use a mail transport command
which accepts different parameters than
<B>sendmail</B>, you can put the name of a
<I>wrapper</I>
command here. For example, this can be the
name of a shell script that converts the
parameters to the format required before
passing them on to the other command.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="KhFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Save interrupted messages to a file</H2>

<P>
If you have been composing a message but you close the
Composition window without first sending the message, the
message will be saved to the file you specify in the
<B>Save interrupted
messages to file</B> field.
<P>
You can disable this function by setting the toggle button
<KBD>Off</KBD>.

<H2><A NAME="OhFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Split large outgoing messages</H2>

<P>
Another preference you can control from this window is the
handling of large messages. MIME messages can be very large,
particularly if they include image files or audio files. Some older
mail transport systems cannot handle huge messages and may
truncate them or refuse to process them. Your messages may
pass through many networks on the way to their ultimate
destination. If any of the intermediate networks cannot handle
huge messages, you will have a problem.
<P>
The MIME protocol has a solution for this problem. Outgoing
messages can be automatically split into two or more parts, and
reassembled into a single message by the recipient's MIME mail
reader. You can specify whether messages are split, and if so, how
large the pieces should be. The default size (100,000 bytes) is a
standard size which should pass through any network.
<P>
When you apply changes,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> asks whether to use the folder
list preferences for the current session only, or for current and
future sessions.

<H2><A NAME="VhFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Check Addresses Before Mailing</H2>

<P>
Toggle this button
<KBD>On</KBD> to cause
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to use the
<B>sendmail</B>
command's address checking option to validate that the
address(es) in your message are valid. This will prevent mail
from bouncing, but it may take a long time to do the checking
depending on the address and how you are connected to the
Internet.
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>If you leave this option disabled, and a
message you send bounces, use the
<B>Resend</B>
function to bounce it back again after you
have determined the correct address. You do
not need to re-compose the message.
<HR>
