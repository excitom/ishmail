<H1><A NAME="6MGD9FBBGK9X3cS">Keyboard Conventions</H1>

<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> windows follow
<CITE>Motif</CITE>
conventions for selecting,
highlighting, and performing actions on selected items using the
keyboard.

<P>
You can use certain combinations of keyboard keys to perform
many of the functions you would perform with a mouse. These
keyboard operations are referred to as
<EM>mnemonics</EM>,
keyboard
<EM>accelerators</EM>, and shortcut key sequences.
<P>
For example, you can use the cursor motion keys
-
<B>right arrow</B>,
<B>left arrow</B>,
<B>up arrow</B>, and
<B>down arrow</B>
- to position the cursor on
an item in a list (such as a mail message in the Main window).
Once the cursor is on an item, you can select it by pressing the
space bar. This is the keyboard equivalent of moving the mouse
pointer to an item in a list and clicking that item to select it.

<P>
You can also use specially mapped key combinations (called
mnemonics) to perform actions, such as
<B>read</B>,
<B>reply</B>,
<B>forward</B>,
<B>delete</B>, and so forth, on highlighted items. You can also perform
these actions using certain keyboard combinations, called
accelerators, such as the "C<B>ontrol</B>" key and/or the "M<B>eta</B>" key
followed by one or more other keystrokes to perform actions
similar to clicking and double-clicking menu items with the
mouse.
<P>
For example, to read a message using the keyboard keys only:
<UL>
<LI>Use the
<B>Tab</B> key to place primary focus in the
<B>Folder
Contents</B> area of the Main window.

<P>

</LI>
<LI>Use the
<B>up arrow</B> or
<B>down arrow</B> keys to place the cursor
on a mail message you wish to read and press the
<B>Space
bar</B> to select that message. Then type the appropriate
<B>Meta</B>-key combination (in this case
<KBD>Meta-M</KBD>) to open the
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down window.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Next, either:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Cursor down to the
<B>Re</B><U>a</U><B>d</B> option and press the
<B>space bar</B> or the
<B>Enter</B> key to select it, or
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Press the
<KBD>a</KBD> key (the mnemonic for the
<B>Re</B><U>a</U><B>d</B>
option), or,
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Type
<KBD>Control-R</KBD> (the keyboard accelerator
sequence for the
<B>Re</B><U>a</U><B>d</B> option).
<P>
(The
<KBD>Control-R</KBD> function works even if the
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down menu is not being displayed.)
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>The
<B>Meta-key</B> sequence is used only for
activating a menu in a window's menu bar.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Keyboard mapping may differ on some
keyboards. On certain keyboards, for
instance, the Alt-key sequence
<KBD>Alt-M</KBD> may
perform the same function that the Meta-key
sequence
<KBD>Meta-M</KBD> would perform on a
different keyboard.

<P>

</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Mnemonics are available for most functions in the pull-down
menus. A
mnemonic is indicated by the underscored letter in the
menu item, such as the
<B>a</B> in the
<B>Re</B><U>a</U><B>d</B> menu item and the
<B>P</B> in the
<U>P</U><B>rint</B> menu item. Mnemonics are not case sensitive. You can type
either a capital
<B>P</B> or a lower-case
<B>p</B> to perform the
<U>P</U><B>rint</B> function.
<P>
<B>Control</B>-key sequences (accelerators) are available for many
functions in the pull-down menus.
<B>Control</B> key sequences are
displayed to the right of each menu item for which the sequence
is available. If a
<B>Control</B>-key sequence is available for a menu
option, you do not have to display the menu first. You can invoke
the menu option directly without first displaying the menu.


<H2><A NAME="ROOARgBlKG9X3cS">Shortcuts</H2>

<P>
You can add "shortcut" buttons to many of your
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> windows
to facilitate performing actions on mail messages. Shortcut
buttons enable you to bypass the normal menu selection process.
See
<A HREF="1dJ1QLB-zWwA0YK.html">Buttons Option</A> for more information about adding custom
buttons to your
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> windows.

<P>
You can also create your own key
sequences by adding the
appropriate resource lines to your
<I>app-defaults/Ishmail</I> file. For
each character sequence you want to create, add two resource
lines similar to these to your
<I>app-defaults/Ishmail</I> file:

<PRE>
*mainShell*mainWindow*&lt;widgetname>.accelerator: Ctrl&lt;Key>X
</PRE>
<PRE>
*mainShell*mainWindow*&lt;widgetname>.acceleratorText: Ctrl + X
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>"<VAR>X</VAR>" can be any character that isn't already
used for another function. Look in the menus
to see which characters are already used.
Look in the
<B>Edit Custom Buttons</B> windows for the
function widgetnames.
