<P>
The
Main window is the first window displayed when you start
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. It contains the
Main window menu bar and two viewing
areas
- the
<B>Open Folders</B> viewing area and the
<B>Folder Contents</B>
viewing area, as shown in
<A HREF="LksRqFB0aG9X3cS.html#7lsRqFB0aG9X3cS">Main Window Components</A>. From the
Main window, you can manage your mail folders and individual
mail messages and customize your
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> interface in a variety
of ways.
<P>
For example, you can configure special shortcut buttons at the
top or bottom or along either side of the window to help speed
certain command functions. You can also change the fonts and
font sizes of the various buttons, lists, and other text within
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> windows. See
<A HREF="2EtRqFB0aG9X3cS.html">Main Window Options Menu</A> for
information about setting these preferences.
<P>
You can resize the Main window using your window manager's
resizing handles at the edges of the window. As you resize the
Main window vertically, the
<B>Open Folders</B> viewing area grows or
shrinks proportionally while the
<B>Folder Contents</B> viewing area
remains the same size. As you resize the Main window
horizontally, both subwindows grow or shrink proportionally.
<P>
Vertical and horizontal scroll bars within the window appear if
the size of a window becomes too small to fully display its
contents.
<P>
You can use the small, square resize button (called a
<EM>sash</EM> in
<CITE>Motif</CITE>
terminology) on the right side of the Main window to change the
relative vertical sizes of the
<B>Open Folders</B> viewing area and the
<B>Folder Contents</B> viewing area.
<P>

<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>The window areas in all figures shown in this
guide are not true representations of full-size
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> windows. In some instances, they have
been cropped and reduced in order to draw
attention to certain elements in the figure.
