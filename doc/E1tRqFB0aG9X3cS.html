<P>
The
<B>Open Folders</B>
viewing area within the Main window contains
icons representing open folders. When you start
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, the
default
<B>In-Box</B> is automatically opened and its contents are
displayed in the
<B>Folder contents</B> viewing area directly below the
<B>Open Folders</B> area. By default, the
<B>In-Box</B> is always open and,
initially, is the
<EM>active</EM>
mail folder. Other mail folders can also be
opened and can be made active, but only one mail folder can be
active at a time as shown in the figure
<A HREF="E1tRqFB0aG9X3cS.html#TFEeRKBeWXwA0YK">Open Folders Area</A>.

<P>
The types of actions you can perform on mail folders are
determined by the
functional states of the folders. Mail folders
have these functional states:
<UL>
<LI>Open
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Selected
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Active
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
All the folders shown in the
<B>Open Folders</B> viewing area are, by
definition,
<EM>open</EM>. One or more of the folders can be selected.

<P>
Various operations from the
<B>Folder Menu</B> apply to selected folders.

<P>
When a mail folder is opened, its contents are copied internally
by
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. Changes you make to the folder affect only this
internal copy until you explicitly save the changes or close the
folder.

<P>
Detailed information about working with mail folders is provided
in
<A HREF="f9tRqFB0aG9X3cS.html">Main Window Folder Menu</A>.
<P>
By default, folders in the viewing area are represented by icons.
The icons are labelled using the UNIX pathname of the folder file
(or directory). Folder names from your default folder directory
are shown using a plus sign (+) as a shorthand form of the folder
directory name. For example,
<I>$HOME/Mail/xyz</I> appears as
<SAMP>+xyz</SAMP>.
<P>
If you open several folders such that not all of the icons fit in the
viewing area, a scroll bar is added to the viewing area. If you
would like to see more folder names without requiring a scroll
bar you can choose to use smaller icons. You can also choose to
display folder names only without icons.
<P>
You can change the size of the viewing area by clicking the
<B>Resize</B>
button and dragging up or down.
<P>
Use the
<A HREF="6wXf7fBT.L9X3cS.html">Folders</A> option of the
<A HREF="2EtRqFB0aG9X3cS.html">Main Window Options Menu</A> to
change the type of icons used in the viewing area.
