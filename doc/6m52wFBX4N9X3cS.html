<P>
A MIME message contains message blocks of a variety of
file-types that can be displayed or created using a number of
tools. You or your organization may prefer one tool over another.
You can also define your own file-types in
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. To handle such
flexibility,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> provides mechanisms for defining unique
file-types and display methods through the use of the mailcap
files.

<P>
The purpose of the mailcap is to indicate to
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> what program
to run in order to show user mail in a given format. With
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>,
it is possible to add a new file-type to all of the mail reading
programs at a site simply by adding a line to a the system
<SAMP>mailcap</SAMP> file. This can be overridden by defining the
<CODE>$SYSMAILCAP</CODE>
environment variable.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> also attempts to read a user-provided
<I>mailcap</I> file in the
user's home directory. This file is
<I>$HOME/.mailcap</I>. This file does
not have to exist. But, if it does, its entries will take precedence
over entries of the same type in the system mailcap file.
<P>
The syntax of a
mailcap file is fairly simple and straightforward.
Any line that starts with
<SAMP>#</SAMP> is a comment. Blank lines are ignored.
Otherwise, each line defines a single mailcap entry for a single
content type. Long lines may be continued by ending them with
a backslash character, "<SAMP>\</SAMP>".
<P>
Each individual
mailcap entry consists of a content-type
specification, a command to execute, and (possibly) a set of
optional flag values. For example, a very simple mailcap entry
might look like this:
<PRE>
image/gif; xloadimage %s
</PRE>
<P>
The optional flags can be used to specify additional information
about the mail-handling command. For example:
<PRE>
image/gif; xloadimage %s; label="A GIF Image"
</PRE>
<P>
can be added to use as a default label to display when a MIME
message arrives with an image/gif type, that provides no
description of itself.
<P>
The type field (image/gif, in the above example) is simply any
legal content type name, as defined by
<CITE>Internet RFC 1341
(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension)</CITE>. In practice, this is
almost any string. It is the string that will be matched against
the "Content-type" header to decide if this is the mailcap entry
that matches the current message.

<P>
Additionally, the type field may specify a subtype or a wildcard
to match all subtypes (for example, "image/*"). A wild card
definition should follow specific definitions, because
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will
attempt to match the first entry it finds.
<P>
The command field is any UNIX command ("xloadimage %s" in
the above example), and is used to specify the interpreter for the
given type of message. Semicolons and backslashes within the
command must be quoted with backslashes. If the command
contains "%s", those two characters will be replaced by the name
of a file that contains the body of the message. If it contains "%t",
those two characters will be replaced by the content-type field,
including the subtype, if any. (That is, if the content-type was
"image/jpeg; opt1=something-else", then "%t" would be replaced
by "image/jpeg".)

<P>
If the command field contains "%{" followed by a parameter name
and a closing "}", then all those characters will be replaced by the
value of the value of the named parameter, if any, from the value
of the Content-type header. Thus, in the earlier example,
"%{opt1}" will be replaced by "something-else". If a parameter is
specified for the command, and the body part does not have a
value for it, then "" (two double quotes representing the empty
string) is substituted on the command line.
<P>
If the command contains a "%e", those two characters will be
replaced by the value of the Content-Transfer-Encoding, if there
is one. This is useful particularly for external-body types, and the
command needs to decode the retrieved body.
<P>
There are two additional built-in parameters; %{ruser} and
%{rpwd}. The first,
<CODE>ruser</CODE>, is where a user-supplied user account
name is substituted on the command line. This is commonly used
for external-body types that use "ftp" as an access-type. The
<CODE>rpwd</CODE>
parameter is for the accompanying password.
<P>
If no "%s" appears in the command field, then instead of placing
the message body in a temporary file,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> passes the body to
the command on the standard input.

<P>
The "notes=xxx" field is an uninterpreted string that is used to
specify the name of the person who installed this entry in the
mailcap file. (The "xxx" may be replaced by any text string.)
<P>
The "test=xxx" field is a command that is executed to determine
whether the mailcap line actually applies. That is, if the
content-type field matches the content-type on the message, but
a "test=" field is present, then the test must succeed before the
mailcap line is considered to "match" the message being viewed.
The command may be any UNIX command, using the same
syntax and the same %-escapes as for the viewing command, as
described above. A command is considered to succeed if it exits
with a zero exit status, and to fail otherwise.
<P>
The "print=xxx" field is a command to use when you want to print
the file. For instance application/postscript type could have an
entry:
<PRE>
application/postscript; ghostview %s; print=lpr -P ps_printer
</PRE>
<P>
The "textualnewlines" field can be used in the rather obscure
case where
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE> default rules for treating newlines in
base64-encoded data are unsatisfactory. By default,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
translates
<B>CRLF</B> to the local newline character in decoded
base64 output if the content-type is "text" (any subtype), but will
not do so otherwise. A mailcap entry with a field of
"textualnewlines=1" will force such translation for the specified
content-type, while "textualnewlines=0" will guarantee that the
translation does not take place even for textual content-types.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> handles the following types automatically, thus negating
a need for mailcap entries for text/plain, text/richtext, multipart/
mixed, multipart/digest, multipart/alternative,
multipart/parallel, message/rfc822, and message/partial. But
this does not preclude creating
<I>mailcap</I> entries for these types if,
for some reason, you'd rather not use the built-in presentation
mechanisms for these types.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> has a default entry for message/external-body in the
mailcap shipped with the program. It is recommended that this
entry not be changed.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> also has default entries for image/gif and audio/basic.
However, if you have a better application for presenting these
types, make the change there.
