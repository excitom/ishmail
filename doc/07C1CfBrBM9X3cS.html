<P>
MIME messages consist of one or more body parts. In the
simplest case, these body parts are strung together sequentially.
However, you can create body parts which, in turn, contain other
body parts. These are referred to as
<I>Container</I> body parts. The
section immediately below describes the four types of containers
you can select.

<P>
<A HREF="07C1CfBrBM9X3cS.html#A9C1CfBrBM9X3cS">Working with Containers</A> describes how to group messages in
containers.

<P>
Select the
<B>A</B><U>d</U><B>d Container</B> -> option if you want to impose structure
on a MIME message you are composing. The
<B>Add container</B> menu
appears.

<DT><U>M</U><B>ixed</B>
<DD>Select this option to create a
Mixed container for one or
more body parts. There are no rules on what types of
body parts may be put in this container form. This is a
"generic" container.
<P>

<DT><B>Message</B>
<U>D</U><B>igest</B>
<DD>Select this option to create a
Message Digest container.
This type of container is used to contain a group of one or
more complete MIME messages (also known as RFC822
messages), for example a group of messages being
forwarded to another recipient.
<P>

<DT><U>A</U><B>lternatives</B>
<DD>Select this option to create an
Alternatives container.
This type of container holds groups of two or more body
parts that contain equivalent information, using
different formatting of access methods. This option is
useful if you aren't sure what level of MIME capability
the recipient(s) of your message have, if you aren't sure
whether they have MIME capability at all, or if you just
wish to give them a choice.
<P>
In an Alternatives container, each body part contains the
same information, accessed or formatted differently. The
first body part contains the simplest version, typically
plain ASCII text. The last body part contains the
preferred version.
<P>
For example, if you send a message containing Enriched
Text, a version of the text with the Enriched Text
attributes stripped out should appear at the front of the
message. If you send a message containing GIFs, or other
types of binary attachments, these cannot be converted
to ASCII. However, any explanatory text you type into
the message will be visible.
<P>
Another way an Alternatives container can be used is to
provide alternate access methods to a file. For example,
when attaching a file to a message the most desirable
way of doing so is as a Local file. However, this is only
available to recipients on the same local network.
Attaching a file using FTP access is a more universal, yet
slower method of attachment. To cover both cases, you
could build an Alternatives container and put two file
attachments in it, each referring to the same file. The
first attachment would be FTP type and the second
(preferred) would be Local file type.
<P>

<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>This option gives you explicit control over
creating an Alternatives container. However,
you will probably find it easier simply to
compose a message normally, then click the
<B>Both if necessary</B> button at the bottom of the
Composition window. The
<I>both</I> in this case
refers to a message with both plain text
alternative and MIME parts.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will
automatically build the Alternatives
container for you, and put a plain ASCII text
version of your message as the first body part.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><U>P</U><B>arallel</B>
<DD>Select this option to create a
Parallel container.This type
of container holds groups of two or more body parts
which are considered related. The recipient of the
message should try to "show" the body parts together.
For example, an MPEG video clip and an Audio clip could
be put in a parallel container. The recipient's mail tool
should try to show the video clip while simultaneously
playing the audio clip.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>While the idea of a Parallel container is good,
in practice it is difficult to implement well.
This is because programs external to
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
are used to show various body parts. In the
example of a video clip and an audio clip, the
MPEG viewer program usually takes several
seconds to start up, while the audio clip can be
played immediately. So, even though
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
could launch both programs simultaneously
you will usually hear the audio clip long
before you see the video.

<P>
Containers provide structure for your MIME messages. You can
group messages as a Message Digest by first creating a Message
Digest container then dragging the messages and dropping them
into the container. (See
<A HREF="GnbqgMBPQJ9X3cS.html#gDB1CfBrBM9X3cS">Using Drag-and-Drop</A> for a discussion of
copying one or more messages into the Composition window.)

<P>
Containers appear in the Composition window as icons, with a
label indicating the container type. The icons flow in-line with
the message text, like included or attached files. Double-click on
a container icon and a new Composition window is opened,
showing its contents. You can create containers within
containers.
<P>
Click on a container label and press and hold the right button
and you get a pop-up menu which lets you do one of the following:
<UL>
<LI>delete the container
<P>

</LI>
<LI>set the container type
<P>

</LI>
<LI>edit the contents of the container (same as double-click
action)
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

MIME messages, see
