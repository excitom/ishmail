<P>
MIME messages
are created using the Composition window.
Either plain ASCII text or
<EM>MIME</EM>
<EM>Enriched Text</EM> can be entered into
the window. Enriched Text attributes are applied by marking
text with left-button drag-select, then pulling down the
<U>E</U><B>dit</B>
menu, which contains options for the various available
attributes. The Composition window is a
<I>wysiwyg</I> editor. When
attributes are applied to text, they are displayed as they should
appear to the recipient.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>There is no way to guarantee that the
appearance of the message in the
Composition window will exactly match what
the recipient sees. First, the recipient may not
have a MIME-capable mail tool. Second,
MIME-capable mail tools may not always
handle Enriched Text, or if they do, they may
not do so in exactly the same way as
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>.
Third, even if the recipient is using
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>,
you may choose a font for the Enriched Text
that is different than the one your recipient is
using to display it.

</P>
<P>
Other data types can be added as
<I>body parts</I>. Body parts can be
either in-line or external. External body parts are most useful for
large data files that you don't want to physically copy, but rather
send a pointer. Body parts are added to the message from the
<U>I</U><B>nclude/Attach</B> -> options on the Message pull down menu. The
former creates and in-line body part while the latter creates an
external body part. (See
<A HREF="bqbqgMBPQJ9X3cS.html">Include/Attach Option</A> for more
information.)
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> does not have the ability to create or edit anything other
than text (plain or Enriched). Files containing data of another
type must be created by some other program.
<P>
Each body part can have a description tag, defined by the user.
After a body part is created, a place holder box is left in the
composition window, containing a button and the description tag.
The button is labeled
<B>Delete</B>. Pressing it causes the body part to be
discarded.
<P>
MIME messages actually consist of 7-bit ASCII text. Rich Text
attributes are included as mark up tags. Other data types are
encoded using a process, similar to
<I>uuencode</I>, which converts
binary data into 7-bit ASCII characters. If a MIME encoded
message is sent to a recipient whose mail reader can't handle
MIME, the message is still readable. However, the Rich Text
markup will appear in the message. For example:
<PRE>
*******************************************************************
<BR>* This message has been encoded using the Multipurpose Internet Mail
<BR>* Extensions (MIME) format. The mail reader you are using does not
<BR>* support MIME. To display the non-text portions of this message you
<BR>* will need a MIME-capable mail reader.
<BR>*******************************************************************
<BR>--bODY.pART.bOUNDARY
<BR>Content-Type: text/richtext;
<BR>charset=us-ascii
<BR>
<BR>Here is a sample message with some rich text.
<BR>&lt;Bold>this is bold face.&lt;/Bold>.
<BR>&lt;Italic> this is italic.&lt;/Italic>
<BR>&lt;nl> &lt;Center> &lt;Underline> This centered text is underlined. &lt;/Underline> &lt;/Center> &lt;nl>
<BR>&lt;Indent>This is indented text.&lt;/Indent>&lt;nl>
<BR>&lt;nl>
<BR>This is how a GIF body part would be shown:
<BR>--bODY.pART.bOUNDARY
<BR>Content-Type: image/gif
<BR>Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
<BR>Content-Description: The company logo
