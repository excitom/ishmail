<H1><A NAME="508NkEBPyK9X3cS">Sharing Folders with Other Mail Programs</H1>

<P>
The mail folder files used by
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, in particular the
<CODE>In-box</CODE>, also
referred to as the "system folder," can be
shared with other
supported mail programs, such as
<CITE>mail</CITE>,
<CITE>mailx</CITE>,
<CITE>elm</CITE>,
<CITE>pine</CITE>,
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>,
and
<CITE>mh</CITE>.
<P>
There are many different mail folder formats, but most UNIX
mail tools use one of three different formats for the data in mail
folders. Programs such as
<CITE>mail</CITE>,
<CITE>mailx</CITE>, and
<CITE>elm</CITE> store mail folders
as files, each file containing one or more mail messages. The
name of the file is the name of the folder. A line starting with the
characters "From" is considered the start of a new message.
<P>
The
<CITE>MMDF</CITE> program also stores folders as a single file containing
one or more messages. However, in
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>-style folders a line
containing four Ctrl-A characters at the beginning and end of
each message is used to separate messages.
<P>
The
<CITE>mh</CITE> program, and related tools such as
<CITE>xmh</CITE> and
<CITE>exmh</CITE>, use a
directory as a mail folder. Mail messages are saved as individual
files in the directory. The folder name is the directory name, and
the names of the files in the directory are numbers corresponding
to the mail message number.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> can work with any of these three mail folder types.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE> ability to share mail files with these other mail
programs gives you the flexibility of accessing your mail folders
via a "dial-up" modem connection from any remote location. In
most cases, such dial-up modem connections are through
character-mode mail programs such as
<CITE>elm, mh, mail</CITE>, and
<CITE>mailx</CITE>.
<P>
If you intend to use a
character-mode interface to access your
mail remotely through a
dial-up connection to the host system on
which your mail resides, you should save your changes to
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
before using the other mail interface. Otherwise you could lose
unsaved changes.

<P>
You can make changes to your mail folders using another mail
interface program such as
<CITE>mail</CITE> or
<CITE>mailx</CITE> while
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> is
simultaneously running on your host system. If you do, the
potential exists for some mail messages to get out of sync with
the internal copies kept by
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, possibly resulting in some
"Read" messages reverting back to "New" status. Some
previously deleted messages may also show up again in
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>.
<P>
As a safeguard against data loss,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> detects changes in the
status of open mail folders. The next time you use
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, it will
notify you with a pop-up window that a folder has been changed
by another program. When that happens,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> always rereads
the folder file to get the most up-to-date copy. As a result, any
changes you previously made while in
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> but didn't save will
be lost.
