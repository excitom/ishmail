<H1><A NAME="Xj52wFBX4N9X3cS">Ishmail Resources</H1>

<P>
This section describes
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> resources. It contains resource
definitions and a sample file.

<P>
In addition to the resources common to
<CITE>X</CITE> and
<CITE>Motif</CITE>, there are a
number of resources that you can add or change to customize
specific features of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>.
<P>
The application looks for these resources in the
<I>$HOME/.ishmailrc</I>
file and the
<I>$HOME/app-defaults/Ishmail</I> file.

<P>
The
<I>$HOME/.ishmailrc</I> file is created when you start
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. At
first, it is empty. When you specify any preference in an
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
<U>O</U><B>ptions</B> menu, the modified resource is written to this file.
<P>
In general, resources that govern color, type fonts, and window
widget labels within the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> application should be added to
your
<I>app-defaults/Ishmail</I> file.

<P>
<HR>
<B>CAUTION:</B>
<BR>Changes you make to the
<I>.ishmailrc</I> file may be
overwritten the next time you change
something using the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
<U>O</U><B>ptions</B> menu.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>Resources should start with the prefix
<KBD>Ishmail*</KBD>, to ensure that they apply only to
the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> program (and don't have adverse
side effects on other programs), and also to
prevent resources defined for other programs
from inadvertently affecting
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
Default resources are found in the
<I>lib</I> subdirectory of where the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> package was installed. For example, if you use the
<B>pkgadd</B> command to install the
SPARC64/OS, the resources will
be in
<I>/opt/ishmail/1.1/lib/Ishmail</I>. If you create a
<I>$HOME/app-defaults/Ishmail</I> file it is not necessary (nor desirable)
to first copy everything from the default file. The resources you
define supplement or override those in the default file.
<P>
If you want resource changes to apply to everyone who is using
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, make the changes to the default file.
<P>
Default resources are separated into several files, grouped by
function. The
<I>Ishmail</I> file contains
<KBD>#include</KBD> statements, which
cause the separate files to be read as if they were all part of a
single, large file. These resource files are:
<DL>
<DT><I>Ishmail.lang</I>
<DD>Contains all the menu and button labels, and various
pop-up messages, that are used in the program. Also,
contains definitions for shortcut key sequences. If you
wanted to create a non-English language version of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, this file and the
<I>Ishmail.help</I> file are what you
would need to change.
<P>

<DT><I>Ishmail.colors</I>
<DD>Contains the color specifications for windows and menus.
There is a related file,
<I>Ishmail.colors-mono</I>, intended for
use if you have a monochrome monitor. There are two
ways to use the monochrome version of this. You can
change the
<I>Ishmail</I> file to include
<I>Ishmail.colors-mono</I>, that
will affect everyone, or put this resource in your
<I>$HOME/.ishmailrc</I> or
<I>$HOME/app-defaults/Ishmail file</I>:
<P>

<PRE>
Ishmail*customization:	-mono
</PRE>

<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>Some graphical desktops, for example
<CITE>HP
VUE</CITE> or the
<CITE>CDE</CITE>
<CITE>Desktop</CITE>, attempt to control
the colors for all programs. Resources in this
file can cause conflicts that result in odd
looking color schemes, or worse, unreadable
color combinations such as white text on a
white background. To fix this, comment out
(put an exclamation point character,
<KBD>!</KBD>, at the
beginning of the line) the
<I>Ishmail.colors</I> line.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><I>Ishmail.fonts</I>
<DD>Contains font definitions for labels, buttons, lists, and
text. There is an alternative file,
<I>Ishmail.fonts.ow</I>, intended
for use on systems using Sun's
<CITE>Open Windows</CITE>
environment.
<P>

<DT><I>Ishmail.help</I>
<DD>Contains all the
<I>quick help</I> messages as well as pointers
to the
<I>on-line help cards</I>, which are defined in
<I>Ishmail.hlp</I>.
<P>

<DT><I>Ishmail.hlp</I>
<DD>Contains the on-line help cards.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>The help cards are read into memory when
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> is started. If you are concerned about
excessive memory use by the program, and
you don't mind loosing the use of the help
cards, comment out the following line, found
in the
<I>Ishmail.help</I> file:
<HR>
</P>
<PRE>
ishmail.helpcardDbFiles:                Ishmail.hlp
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<B>WARNING:</B>
<BR>The help card file contains a table at the end
which defines offsets into the file where help
cards are located. This table greatly speeds
access to the help cards. However, this makes
it very difficult to change the wording of the
help cards, such as translating them to
another language. If you change the length of
a help card you will invalidate the offsets in
the table, resulting in scrambled help cards
when they are used.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><I>Ishmail.misc</I>
<DD>Contains everything not in the other files, such as:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Name of the external editor command
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Name of the spelling checker command
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Name of the web browser command
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Name of the command used to send mail
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Window geometries
<P>

</LI>
<LI>3D visual attributes
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Icon definitions
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Margins and spacing control
<P>

</LI>
<LI>etc.
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
</DL>
<P>
Other default resource files, not directly related to
<CITE>X</CITE> or
<CITE>Motif</CITE>, are:
<DL>
<DT><I>mailcap</I>
<DD>Defines the methods used for composing, viewing, and
printing various MIME data types. The following section
describes this file in more detail.
<P>
Edit this file to make changes that will affect all
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
users. Or, you can add entries to your
<I>$HOME/.mailcap</I> file
to specify your own utilities for viewing and printing
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> messages that contain MIME content.

<P>

<DT><I>mime.types</I>
<DD>Defines the default MIME data type for various file name
suffixes. For example, a file named
<I>xyz.gif</I> is assumed to
be a GIF file. This relationship is used when you include
or attach a file to a message.
<P>
Edit this file to make changes that will affect all
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
users. Or, you can add entries to your
<I>$MIMETYPES</I> file
to specify relationship between file names and data
types.

<P>

<DT><I>mailrc</I>
<DD>Defines e-mail aliases common to all
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> users. The
format of the alias entries is the same as defined for the
<CITE>sendmail</CITE> aliases file.
<P>
The resource
<KBD>Ishmail*groupAliasFile:</KBD> can be set to
refer to a different alias file.
<P>
Edit this file to make changes that will affect all
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
users. Or, you can add entries to your
<I>$HOME/.mailrc</I> file
to specify your own e-mail aliases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>Use the
<B>Aliases</B> dialog from the Main window
<B>Options</B> menu to make changes to your
<I>$HOME/.mailrc</I> file. If you have write
permission for the
<I>mailrc</I> file, you can use the
<B>Group Aliases</B> dialog from the Main window
<B>Options</B> menu to make changes to it.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR><CITE>Ishmail</CITE> can also use e-mail aliases defined for
other programs such as
<CITE>elm</CITE>,
<CITE>pine</CITE>, and
<CITE>Zmail</CITE>.
For example, to use
<CITE>pine</CITE> aliases, add this
resource to your
<I>$HOME/app-defaults/Ishmail</I>
file:
<HR>
</P>
<PRE>
Ishmail*otherAliasFiles: $HOME/.addressbook
</PRE>
<DT><I>XKeysymDB</I>
<DD>Contains keyboard mappings.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>If you see various warning messages from the
X server about problems mapping keys, try
commenting out the following line in the
<B>ishmail</B> shell script:
<HR>
</P>
<PRE>
XKEYSYMDB=$ISHLIB/XKeysymDB; export XKEYSYMDB
