<P>
The
Comment on Application window is a special version of the
Composition window. It is intended for composing messages to be
sent to
H&L Technical Support.

<P>
It shares the "look and feel" of the Composition window and
contains many of its standard elements, including pull-down
menus, subject and recipient text fields, a multiple-line message
composition field, and an append signature button. However, the
Comment on Application window also contains several
window-specific fixed fields for supplying information that is
exclusive to the H&L support staff. (See the figure "Elements of
the Comment on Application Window" below.)
<P>
For general information about using the pull-down menus and
other standard components in the Comment on Application
window, refer to
<A HREF="Vj-1vFBulI9X3cS.html">Composition Window</A>. For information about
using the Help menu system, refer to
<A HREF="DEtRqFB0aG9X3cS.html">Help Menu Options</A>.
<P>
The Comment on Application window-specific components are
described below.
<P>
To launch the Comment on Application window, click the
<U>C</U><B>omment ...</B> option in the main window
<U>F</U><B>ile</B> pull-down menu.

<P>
The Comment on Application window contains a number of fixed
fields. You cannot edit any of the text in fixed field areas, but you
can click radio buttons in the
<B>Category</B> and
<B>Weight</B> fields that
identify the type of comment you are making and the priority of
your comment. The fixed fields are:
<DL>
<DT><B>Product</B>
<DD>Identifies the type of H&L product you are using, in this
case, a communications product.

<P>

<DT><B>Component</B>
<DD>Identifies the specific application component, in this
case, the H&L Mail Tool.
<P>

<DT><B>Version</B>
<DD>Shows the version number of the component.
<P>

<DT><B>Category</B>
<DD>Identifies a category for your comment. To select a
category, click the button to the left of the item that most
closely describes your comment:
<P>

<UL>

</LI>
<LI>Performance
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Function
<P>

</LI>
<LI>User Interface

commenting on an element of the application that is just
a minor annoyance, weight your comment appropriately.
