<H1><A NAME="wmbqgMBPQJ9X3cS">Composing and Sending a Message</H1>

<P>
Once you have invoked the Composition window, you fill in the
appropriate text fields, compose your message, then click one of
the send options described in
<A HREF="Iq-1vFBulI9X3cS.html">Composition Message Menu</A>.

<P>
The sections that follow describe the Composition window text
fields.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If you invoked the Composition window using
one of the reply options, some of the text fields
will already be filled in for you. See
<A HREF="3T8YifBdqH9X3cS.html">Composition Options</A> for an explanation of the
reply options.

<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="0nbqgMBPQJ9X3cS">Header Fields</H2>

<P>
The Composition window contains up to six header fields for
specifying message recipients, message subject, and additional
message headers. But only the
<B>To:</B> field is a mandatory text field.

<P>
To control which headers are shown, how the header fields are
organized, and how many rows are showing in each field, click
the
<B>Window ...</B> option and choose settings in the
<B>Composition Window
Preferences</B> dialog.
<P>
Header text fields scroll horizontally to accommodate lengthy
entries. Use the arrow keys to scroll existing text that is beyond
the margins. They also can scroll vertically to accommodate
multiple lines (except the
<B>Subject:</B> field, which is always a single
line). A vertical scroll bar appears, as necessary, if you enter
multiple lines in a field.
<P>
You can press the
<KBD>Tab</KBD> key or the
<KBD>Ctrl-Tab</KBD> key to move the
cursor different text fields, or you can simply click the mouse
pointer in each field. Also, you can press the
<B>Return</B> key while in
the
<B>Subject:</B> field, and the cursor will advance to the next field. In
the other header fields, pressing
<B>Return</B> adds a new line to the
field.
<P>
The
header fields are described below:
<DL>
<DT><B>To:</B>
<DD>Mandatory
field. Identifies primary recipients of the
message.
<P>

<DT><B>Subject:</B>
<DD>Optional
field. Identifies the subject matter of the
message.
<P>
Enter a brief description of the message in this field.

<P>

<DT><B>Cc:</B>
<DD>Optional
field. Identifies secondary recipients of the
message.

<P>

<DT><B>Bcc:</B>
<DD>Optional
field. Identifies recipients who will receive
<I>blind</I>
copies of the message. Blind copy recipients remain
unknown to other recipients of the message.

<P>

<DT><B>Fcc:</B>
<DD>Optional
field. Identifies names of one or more folders
into which the message will be copied when sent.
<P>

<DT><B>Additional
headers:</B>
<DD>Optional field. Provides additional header information
for the recipient(s).
<P>
Enter additional headers to be added to the standard
message headers in the outgoing message. The content of
this additional header information should be in
conformance with
<CITE>RFC-822</CITE>. Please refer to
<CITE>RFC-822</CITE> for
more information about the supported syntax and
content of additional header information.
<P>
By default, this field is not automatically displayed when
you open the Composition window. To display the field,
select the
<B>Show</B>
<U>A</U><B>dditional:</B> button in the Composition
window
<U>O</U><B>ptions</B> pull-down menu.
<P>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="pzDI2.BsKL9X3cS">Address Formats</H3>

<P>
There are
many valid formats for e-mail addresses, which are
used in the
<B>To:</B>,
<B>Cc:</B>, and
<B>Bcc:</B> fields. Following are three of the most
commonly used on the Internet:
<UL>
<LI><KBD>user@site</KBD>
<P>

</LI>
<LI><KBD>user@site (Real Name)</KBD>
<P>

</LI>
<LI><KBD>Real Name &lt;user@site></KBD>
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Only the
<KBD>user@site</KBD> part is the e-mail address, the rest is
<I>comment text</I> which makes the address more readable. You can
type addresses with or without the comment text. To save space
in the header fields,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> strips the comment text when you
are replying to or forwarding a message. (You can override this
behavior by setting parameters in the
<U>R</U><B>eply/Forward ...</B> dialog. See
<A HREF="uhFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Reply/Forward Preferences</A>.)
<P>
You can put multiple addresses on a single header or on multiple
lines.

<DL>
<DT>Multiple addresses on a single line
<DD>You can type one or more addresses on a single line,
separated by commas. After you fill the header field the
text scrolls to the left. You can use the cursor arrow keys,
as well as other editing keys while in the header field.

<P>
If you enter spaces as part of the comment text of an
address, you must enclose the comment text in
parenthesis or you must enclose the e-mail address
between less-than and greater-than characters (angle
brackets). You must also toggle
<KBD>off</KBD> the
<B>Allow spaces to
delimit addresses</B> option in the
<A HREF="XBFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Composition Window
Preferences</A> dialog window.
<P>
If a comma is part of the comment text, the comment text
must be enclosed in parenthesis.
<P>

<DT>Multiple address lines
<DD>You can press the
<B>Return</B> (or
<B>Enter</B>) key after an address,
and each address appears on a separate line. A vertical
scroll bar is added to the field if you add more lines than
will fit.
<P>
If a comma is part of the comment text of an address, the
comment text must be enclosed in parenthesis.
<P>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="5.DI2.BsKL9X3cS">Automatic Comma Insertion</H3>

<P>
In previous versions of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>, a comma was inserted
automatically when you typed space between addresses. This
eliminated the need to type commas. Unfortunately, it also made
it difficult to enter addresses with spaces in the comment text.
There were some legal forms of e-mail addresses which could not
be used without
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> sticking in extra commas. So, the comma
insertion feature was disabled. If you liked this feature, and
weren't bothered by the problems it caused, you can enable
automatic comma insertion by toggling
<KBD>On</KBD> the
<B>Allow spaces to delimit
addresses</B> option in the
<B>Composition Window Preferences</B> dialog. (See
<A HREF="XBFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Composition Window Preferences</A>.)

<H2><A NAME="B.DI2.BsKL9X3cS">Using Aliases</H2>

<P>
You can use aliases for e-mail addresses. These are shorthand
forms of addresses, or names for a group of e-mail addresses (for
example, a mailing list). The
<A HREF="8lI1QLB-zWwA0YK.html">Aliases Option</A> lets you define and
modify aliases.
<P>
To use an alias, simply type it into one of the header fields that
accepts e-mail addresses. You can
expand
aliases (convert them
to their corresponding address or list of addresses) in any header
field by clicking the mouse cursor in the header and typing
<B>Ctrl-A</B>.
<P>
To see a list of available aliases that can be used in a header, click
the "..." button just above and at the right hand side of the header
field. The
<B>Select Aliases</B> window is opened.
<P>
<H4>Figure: <A NAME="I.DI2.BsKL9X3cS">The Select Aliases Window</H4>

<IMG SRC="wmbqgMBPQJ9X3cS.extobj.1.gif">
<P>
The
<B>Select Aliases</B> window shows you a single list of aliases
combined from one or more sources. The default source of aliases
is you
<I>$HOME/.mailrc</I> file. You can also share a
<I>mailrc</I> file with a
group of people, and you can also use aliases from other
programs, such as
<CITE>elm</CITE>,
<CITE>pine</CITE>, or
<CITE>zmail</CITE>.
<P>
In your
<I>$HOME/.ishmailrc</I> file you specify the location of group or
other alias
files. For example:
<PRE>
*groupAliasFile:	/opt/ishmail/1.1/lib/mailrc
</PRE>
<PRE>
*otherAliasFiles:	$HOME/.addressbook $HOME/.zmailrc
</PRE>
<P>
The list of aliases has two columns. The
<B>Alias</B> column is on the left.
The
<B>Address</B> column on the right shows the value the alias will
expand to. This can be an e-mail address or a comma-separated
list of aliases or e-mail addresses.
<P>
To pick an alias from the list, click to highlight it then click the
<B>OK</B> button or the
<B>Apply</B> button. You can use drag select, Ctrl-click
or Shift-click to pick multiple aliases, which will all be copied to
the header field, separated by commas.
<P>
A vertical scroll bar is added to the list if there are more entries
than will fit in the window. A horizontal scroll bar is show across
the bottom of the list if one or more addresses are too wide to fit
in the window. If there are both horizontal and vertical scroll
bars a joy stick is shown in the lower right corner, which can be
used to pan the aliases and addresses list.
<P>
If you have many aliases, you may find the search function
useful. Type a value into the
<B>Search string:</B> field and press one of the
<B>Find Next</B>,
<B>Find Prev</B>, or
<B>Find All</B> buttons.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will look for a
case-insensitive match for the string in both the
<B>Address</B> and
<B>Alias</B>
columns.
<P>
Aliases in the list are sorted alphabetically. See
<A HREF="8lI1QLB-zWwA0YK.html">Aliases Option</A>
for more information.
<P>
If you toggle the
<B>Use expanded value</B> button
<KBD>On</KBD>, the value from the
<B>Address</B> column is copied to the header field. Otherwise the value
from the
<B>Alias</B> column is copied. If the alias is copied, you can
subsequently press Ctrl-A in the header field to expand it to its
corresponding address.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> expands any aliases not yet
expanded when you send the message.

<H2><A NAME="w8EI2.BsKL9X3cS">Using the Folder Carbon Copy field</H2>

<P>
The
<B>Fcc:</B> field lets you tell
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> the names of one or more folders
into which the outgoing message should be automatically copied.
You can type one or more path names of folders, each on a
separate line.
<P>
If the folder doesn' t already exist it is created for you. The type
of the folder (<CITE>UNIX</CITE>,
<CITE>mh</CITE>, or
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>) is determined by an option you
set in the
<A HREF="6wXf7fBT.L9X3cS.html">Folder Preferences</A> dialog.
<P>
You can tell
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to fill in the name of the folder automatically.
The name can be the same folder each time, or it can vary based
on the e-mail addresses you are using. See
<A HREF="lQFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Outgoing Mail
Preferences</A> for more information.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>You can also type folder names in the
<B>To:</B>,
<B>CC:</B>,
and
<B>Bcc:</B> fields. Any address that starts with:
<KBD>/</KBD>,
<KBD>./</KBD>,
<KBD>+</KBD>, or
<KBD>=</KBD> is treated as a folder name.
