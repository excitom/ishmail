<P>
It is possible to request the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> program
to perform certain
whose effects are irreversible, such as permanently deleting a
mail folder or clearing the contents of the current Composition
window. To make
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> friendly to use, these actions cause a
pop-up window to be opened that requests you to confirm that
you
<EM>really</EM> want to perform a certain action.
<P>
Experienced users of
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> may become annoyed, however, at
seeing a confirmation pop-up window when their answer to the
question
<I>always</I> is "Yes, I know what I'm doing."
<P>
The
<B>Confirmation Preferences</B> window lets you selectively disable the
confirmation pop-up windows for various actions.
<P>
Actions that can be selectively confirmed include:
<DL>
<DT>Quit and Exit
<DD>Do you really want to quit (or exit) from
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>?
<P>

<DT>Save changes during exit
