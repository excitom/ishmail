<P>
The MIME specification defines a way to compose, send, receive,
read, file, and print mail messages containing multi-media (in
other words: audio, video, graphical images, binary files, etc.)
data in addition to ASCII text. The specification also includes
<EM>Enriched Text</EM>, which lets you enhance the presentation of ASCII
text with attributes such as different fonts and font sizes, bold
face, italic, underlined, centered text, indented text, etc.
<P>
The MIME specification defines a message format that is
backward-compatible with existing Internet mail. In other
words, existing mail tools can be used to read, file, and reply to
MIME messages. However, the readability of parts of the
message depends on the type of data it contains. For example, if
you use a non-MIME capable mail tool to read a MIME message
containing audio or video data you should not expect that data to
be presented in a usable format - but your mail tool will not crash
just because you tried to read the MIME-encoded data. However,
if you use a non-MIME capable mail tool to read a MIME
message which contains only ASCII text, you will likely have no
trouble reading the message.
<P>
To insure complete compatibility with existing Internet mail
systems, all messages (MIME or otherwise) must contain only
7-bit ASCII data. A key part of the MIME specification defines
rules for converting arbitrary binary data into 7-bit ASCII, for
transmission through the Internet, then converting it back again
to its original format, without loss or corruption of data.
