<P>
When you click the
<U>W</U><B>indow ...</B> option, the
<B>Composition Window
Preferences</B> dialog appears.

<P>

<P>
Use the
<B>Composition Window Preferences</B> dialog to control the size and
format of the Composition window, control text wrapping,
keystroke bindings, alternate editor command, and spelling
checker command.
<P>
Explicit help is available in the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B> pull-down menu for each of
the parameters that can be customized. From the
<U>H</U><B>elp</B> pull-down
menu, select the
<U>O</U><B>n Context</B> function, then move the cursor over
the item of interest and click the mouse.

<H2><A NAME="rOFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Rows, Columns, and Wrapping Text</H2>

<P>
You can set the number of rows and columns that are shown in
the Composition window. If the text in the window needs more
rows or columns than are available, scroll bars are placed on the
text area borders. If you have turned on the
<B>Wrap text at right margin</B>
option,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will reformat the text to fit the window width
rather than use a horizontal scroll bar.
<P>
Another way to change the size of the window is to click on the
outside window border and drag horizontally or vertically.
Changes made this way do not stay in effect the next time you
run
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>.
<P>
With the
<B>Wrap text at right margin</B> button, you can control whether
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will insert "soft newlines" into your text as you type past
the right margin. The effect is that the cursor will return to the
left margin, one row down.
<P>
You can also specify how many rows should be shown for each of
the header fields, except the subject line (which is always a single
line). When you specify multiple addresses in the
<KBD>To:</KBD>,
<KBD>Cc:</KBD>,
<KBD>Bcc:</KBD>, or
<KBD>Fcc:</KBD> fields you can place each address on a separate
line. The fields will show a vertical scroll bar if you enter more
addresses than there are rows in the field. Similarly, you can
enter multiple extra mail headers, placing each on a separate
line.

<H2><A NAME="1PFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Message Header Fields</H2>

<P>
You can specify which header fields are shown, or hidden, in the
Composition window. Since each field occupies space in the
window, you can minimize the size of the Composition window by
showing only the fields you need to use. You set the default here,
which can be overridden for individual messages.
<P>
You can also specify how many header fields are shown on a
single line. Putting multiple fields on a line reduces the vertical
size required for the composition.

<H2><A NAME="6PFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Key Bindings</H2>

<P>
You can set the bindings for short cut keys to mimic either the
standard
<CITE>Motif</CITE> edit functions or the
<CITE>emacs</CITE> editor functions.

<P>
You can also control whether the
<B>Delete</B> key deletes characters
from the right of the cursor, or if it works like the
<B>Backspace</B> key
and deletes to the left of the cursor.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If you toggle either the
<B>Use Emacs key bindings</B>
key or the
<B>Delete key works like Backspace</B> key, you
must exit and restart
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> for this change
to take effect.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
The following table summarizes the key bindings. The
<CITE>Motif</CITE> key
is shown first followed by the
<CITE>emacs</CITE> equivalent key. Note that
the
<CODE>Meta</CODE> key is the key with the diamond symbol next to the
<B>Alt</B>
key on
<CITE>Sun</CITE> keyboards. If your keyboard doesn't have a
<B>Meta</B> key,
the
<B>Alt</B> key serves this function.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="JQFI2.BsKL9X3cS">Specifying Multiple Addresses</H2>

<P>
When you specify more than one address in the
<KBD>To:</KBD>,
<KBD>Cc:</KBD>,
<KBD>Bcc:</KBD>,
or
<KBD>Fcc:</KBD> fields you can place each address on a separate line, by
pressing the
<KBD>Return</KBD> (or
<KBD>Enter</KBD>) key after each one.
<P>
Or, you can type multiple addresses on a single line, provided
that you type a comma between each address.
<P>
Some mail tools let you specify multiple addresses just by typing
a space between each. For compatibility,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> lets you do this
too, if you turn
<KBD>on</KBD> the
<B>Allow spaces to delimit addresses</B> button.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>If you allow spaces to delimit addresses you
will not be able to enter addresses containing
comment information, since these will fool the
comma insertion logic into thinking you have
entered more than one address.
<HR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="QQFI2.BsKL9X3cS">External Commands - Editor and Spell
Checker</H2>

<P>
When you use the
<U>E</U><B>ditor ...</B> function in the Composition window
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down menu,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> starts the alternate editor
program you have specified as the
<B>External editor command</B>. The
contents of the Composition window are passed to the editor, and
any changes you make are passed back to the Composition
window when you exit the editor.
<P>
<B>NOTES:</B>
<OL>
<LI>If you have applied
<I>Enriched Text</I> formatting
in the Composition window, and if your
message type is MIME, you will see the MIME
text markup commands mixed in with the
text when you use an external editor.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>You cannot completely bypass the
Composition window, using only an external
editor to compose messages. This is because
the Composition window controls the building
of MIME data structures within your
message.
<P>

</LI>
</OL>
<P>
You can also supply the name of an external command to check
your spelling. When you use the
<B>Check s</B><U>p</U><B>elling ...</B> function in the
Composition window
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> starts the spell
checker program and passes it the contents of the Composition
window. Changes you make with the spell checker are reflected
back to the Composition window when you exit the spell checker.
<P>
<HR>
<B>TIP:</B>
<BR>The default spell checker is the public domain
<CITE>ispell</CITE> command. This is not supplied as part of
the
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> product. If you don't have
<CITE>ispell</CITE>,
contact
<KBD>support@ishmail.com</KBD>
for assistance in getting it.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
For either command, the
<I>$FILE</I> parameter specifies the name of
a temporary file which holds the contents of the Composition
window.
<P>
When specifying commands that don't create their own window,
use the
<CITE>term</CITE> command to create a window and supply the spell
checker or editor command name as the
<KBD>-e</KBD> parameter to
<CITE>term</CITE>.
Commands, such as
<CITE>emacs</CITE>, which create their own window can
be used directly, for example:
<PRE>
emacs $FILE
</PRE>
