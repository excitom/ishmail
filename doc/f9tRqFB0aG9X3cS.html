<P>
This section describes the options available in the
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B>
pull-down menu. To see the
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> pull-down menu options, click
the
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> button, or type
<B>Meta-O</B>. The following menu appears:

<P>
The
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> pull-down menu contains options for managing your
mail folders. From the
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> pull-down menu, you can make a
mail folder active, create new mail folders, open, close, and save
changes to mail folders, and select or deselect mail folders.

<P>
Message folders are files that contain one or more mail messages.
The system folder, called the
<B>In-Box</B>, is the default mailbox. It is
opened and displayed when you launch
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>. Incoming mail
messages are stored in the
<B>In-Box</B> until you delete them or move
them to a different folder. Each
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> user has a unique
<B>In-Box</B>.

<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> can work with three different types of folder formats,
which together are the most commonly used among mail
programs. You should be able to use existing mail folders created
by most other mail programs. The supported folder formats are:
<UL>
<LI>UNIX (<CITE>mailx</CITE>)
<P>

</LI>
<LI><CITE>mh</CITE>
<P>

</LI>
<LI><CITE>MMDF</CITE>
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
See
<A HREF="6wXf7fBT.L9X3cS.html">Folder Preferences Option</A> for more information about folder
formats.
<P>
You can create other folders and use them for organizing
messages. The folders can exist anywhere in the file system that
you have read/write privileges, and you can assign to them any
name you wish within the limits of your operating system's file
naming conventions. The file system directory structure can be
used to provide a hierarchy for collections of folders.
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR>Security and
access privileges for folders are
the same as those provided for files in the
UNIX file system.
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> does not provide any
additional access controls or security.

To choose an option in the
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> pull-down menu, either click on
the option, type its associated mnemonic (the underscored letter
in the option's name) or type its associated
<B>Ctrl</B>-key sequence.
Some
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> options have an additional cascading menu and/or
dialog window.
<B>Fo</B><U>l</U><B>der</B> options are:

<UL>
<LI>The
<B>Create New Folder</B> window has radio buttons
which let you choose one of the three possible
formats for the folder. A UNIX-type folder is a
file containing one or more mail messages. Use
this
folder type if you want the mail folder to be
usable by other mail tools such as
<CITE>mailx</CITE> or
<CITE>elm</CITE>.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>An
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>-type folder is a file containing one or
more mail messages. Use this folder type if you
want the folder to be usable by other mail tools
such as
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>An
<CITE>MH</CITE>-type folder is a directory containing files,
each of which is a mail message. Use this folder
type if you want the mail folder to be usable by
other mail tools such as

<DD>This option launches the
<A HREF="f9tRqFB0aG9X3cS.html#35iauyBGnK9X3cS">Select Folders Window</A>, in
which you specify the names of one or more folders you
want to open. You can either type the names of the
folders or click the
<B>Show List</B> option to select from the list
of folders. (See
<A HREF="uO2ZgMB8BJ9X3cS.html">Using the File Selection Window</A>.)

<P>
When you open multiple folders, an icon representing
each folder is added to the
<B>Open Folders</B> area. The first
folder in the group automatically becomes the active
folder.

<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR><CITE>Ishmail</CITE> supports three types of
folders:
<CITE>UNIX</CITE>-type,
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>-type, and
<CITE>mh</CITE>-type.
<CITE>UNIX</CITE>-type and
<CITE>MMDF</CITE>-type folders are files
which contain one or more mail messages.
<CITE>mh</CITE>-type folders are directories which contain
one or more files, each of which is a single mail
message. If you are using
<CITE>mh</CITE>-type folders, you
will see their names in
<I>both</I> the
<B>Directories</B> list
and the
<B>Folders</B> list. You can open an
<CITE>mh</CITE>-type
folder from either list, but it is preferable to
open from the
<B>Folders</B> list.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
<B>TIPS:</B>
<OL>
<LI>You can use a
<KBD>+</KBD> (plus sign) or
<KBD>=</KBD> (equal sign) at
the beginning of the name to refer to you
folder directory. For example:
<KBD>=folder</KBD> is the
same as
<KBD>$HOME/Mail/folder</KBD>.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>If you type a relative path name, it is resolved
relative to your home directory. For example:
<KBD>dir/folder</KBD> is the same as
<KBD>$HOME/dir/folder</KBD>.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>You can use wildcard characters and shell
environment variables in the names, which
are expanded by your login shell. For
example:
<KBD>$HOME/Mail/ishmail*</KBD> will open
all folders with names beginning with
<I>ishmail</I>
in your
<I>$HOME/Mail</I> directory.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>You can refer to multiple folders by typing a
carriage return between names.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>If you are not using
<CITE>mh</CITE>-style mail folders you
may find it confusing to see folder directories
in the both the
<B>Directories</B> list and in the
<B>Folders</B>
list of the
<B>Select Folders</B> dialog. Conversely, if
you are using
<CITE>mh</CITE>-style folders you may find it
confusing to see non-directory files in the
<B>Folders</B> list. You can control which types of
names are shown in the
<B>Folders</B> list by selecting
options in the
<B>Folder Preferences</B> dialog window.

the choice to
<B>Open and activate</B> or

<A HREF="f9tRqFB0aG9X3cS.html#35iauyBGnK9X3cS">Select Folders Window</A> dialog. The
<B>Open only</B> option is provided to improve performance when
you are opening many folders or large folder.
<P>
Selecting the
<U>A</U><B>ctivate </B>-> option causes a cascading menu
to be displayed from which you can choose one of two
selection options:

</DL>
<DT><U>S</U><B>ave </B>->
<DD>Saves
any changes you've made to one or more folders.

When you
<B>Save changes</B>,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> makes permanent any
changes you have made to the status of messages (for
example, reading a new message, so that its status
changes from
<CODE>New</CODE> to
<CODE>Read</CODE>), and any alterations you have
made to the active folder (such as deleting or undeleting
messages).
<P>
Selecting the
<U>S</U><B>ave </B>-> option causes a cascading menu to

<B>Open Folders</B>
area. Only those folders which have been
changed are saved.
<P>

</DL>
<DT><U>R</U><B>eread </B>->
<DD>This option causes
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to discard its internal cache of
information about the folder and re-read the folder file.
<P>
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> keeps a cache of information about folders in
order to improve performance when accessing a folder.
However, this information can become out of date if
changes to the folder are made by another mail program.
Typically,
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> will detect that the information is out
of date and rebuild the cache automatically. This option
assures you that the cached information is correct by
telling
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> to rebuild the cache explicitly.

<P>
Selecting the
<U>R</U><B>eread </B>-> option causes a cascading menu to
be displayed from which you can choose one of three
selection options:

<DD>Rebuild the cache for the folder currently
displayed in the
<B>Folder Contents</B> area.

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<B>NOTE:</B>
<BR><CITE>Ishmail</CITE> saves cached information about
folders in files, so that it can open the folder
more quickly the next time you start the
program or open the folder. These files are
kept in the same directory as the
corresponding folder. The name of the file is
the folder name with a
<I>.</I> (period) prefix and a
<I>-toc</I> suffix. For example: The folder
<I>sample</I> will
have a cache file called .<I>sample-toc</I>. You can
delete these files if you wish. The effect will be
that
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE> must rebuild the cache the next
time the folder is opened.
<HR>
</P>
<DT><U>C</U><B>lose </B>->
<DD>Closes one or more mail folders. Selecting the
<U>C</U><B>lose </B>->
option causes a cascading menu to be displayed from

<P>

<DL>
<DT><U>C</U><B>urrent folder</B>
<DD>Closes the currently active folder, causing its
icon to be removed from the
<B>Open Folders</B> viewing
area. The

and its contents are displayed in the
<B>Folder
Contents</B> viewing area.

<P>
If any changes you have made to the current
folder are outstanding, a confirmation dialog
window asks if you wish to save the changes
before closing the folder.

<P>

<DT><U>S</U><B>elected</B>
<DD>Closes one or more selected folders, causing
their icons to be removed from the
<B>Open Folders</B>
viewing area. If a selected folder is currently
active, the
<B>In-Box</B> then becomes the active folder
by default, and its contents are displayed in the
<B>Folder Contents</B> viewing area.

<P>
If any changes you have made to the selected
folder(s) are outstanding, a dialog window asks
if you wish to save the changes before closing
the folder.
