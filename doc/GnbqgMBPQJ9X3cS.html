<H1><A NAME="GnbqgMBPQJ9X3cS">Message Compose Field</H1>

<P>
The
message compose field is a multiple-line text field in which
you enter the text of your mail message. Click inside the message
compose field to enter the text of your message.
<P>
If you have text-wrapping
<B>ON</B> (see
<A HREF="XBFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Composition Window
Preferences</A>), the text you enter into the compose field
automatically
word-warps to a new line when it reaches the right
margin. When the text reaches the bottom margin of the compose
field, the window area automatically scrolls vertically. If you
resize the window vertically or horizontally, the message
compose field resizes itself proportionally.

<H2><A NAME="QCLdWQBJqM9X3cS">Ishmail Text Editor</H2>

<P>
The
<CITE>Ishmail</CITE>
text editor uses enhanced
<CITE>Motif</CITE> text editing functions
in all text fields, including the message compose field. The editor
operates in insert mode. That is, new text is always inserted to
the left of the cursor, expanding the text field and any existing
text to the right.

<P>
Here are the essential functions of
<CITE>Ishmail's</CITE> text editor:

<H3><A NAME="UCLdWQBJqM9X3cS">Entering Text</H3>

<UL>
<LI>To
enter
text in a blank text field, click the pointer at the
beginning of the field to activate the cursor, then start
typing.
<P>
The field expands to the right as you enter text. If you
have text-wrapping set to
<B>ON</B>, the text wraps as you reach
the right margin. However, you can use the
<B>Return</B> key
at the end of each line to limit line width if you like.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>To enter new text into an existing line of text, click the
pointer at the desired location (or use the arrow keys to
position the cursor) and start typing. Text to the right of
the cursor is pushed to the right as you type.
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="YCLdWQBJqM9X3cS">Scrolling Text</H3>

<P>

<B>Delete</B> key perform similar
functions:
<UL>
<LI>Press the
<B>Back Space</B> key to delete text to the left of the
cursor a character at a time.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Press the
<B>Delete</B> key to delete text to the right of the

<A HREF="XBFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Composition Window Preferences</A> dialog.
<HR>
</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
You can also select (highlight) text, then delete it, as described
below.

<H3><A NAME="hCLdWQBJqM9X3cS">Selecting Text</H3>

<P>
There are several ways to
select
text. Selected text is highlighted
to indicate the range of the selection. You can perform a number
of different functions on selected text, including cut, copy, and
paste functions.


<H4><A NAME="jCLdWQBJqM9X3cS">Selecting Text with the
Mouse</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Drag-select the character(s), word(s), or line(s) you want
to select.

<P>

</LI>
<LI>Double-click a word to select it.

<P>
You can expand the selection horizontally a word at a
time by holding the left mouse button down on the second
click, then moving the mouse pointer in the direction
that you want the selection to expand.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Triple-click anywhere on a line to select a line. (A line is
defined as the text between the beginning of the line and
the next carriage return character.)
<P>
You can expand your selection by holding the left mouse
button down on the third click, then moving the mouse
pointer up or down to expand the selection a line at a
time.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Quadruple-click to select all of the text in the field.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Click, then release, the left mouse button to place the
cursor at the start of your selection. Then shift-click the
left mouse button at the end of your intended selection.
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="qCLdWQBJqM9X3cS">Selecting Text with the

character at a time to the right or left of the initial cursor
position.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Control-Shift-Right arrow or Control-Shift-Left arrow to
highlight a word (and space) at a time to the right or left
of the initial cursor position.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Shift-Up arrow or Shift-Down arrow to highlight text a
line at a time above or below the initial cursor position.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Control-Shift-Up arrow or Control-Shift-Down arrow to
highlight a paragraph at a time above or below the initial
cursor position.
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="vCLdWQBJqM9X3cS">Cutting, Copying, and
Pasting Selected Text</H3>

<P>
Selected text is automatically copied to either a temporary
mouse buffer storage area or a temporary keyboard buffer
storage area depending on the selection method you use.

<UL>
<LI>To place text into the temporary mouse buffer area,
simply select it using any of the mouse selection methods
described above. The selected text is automatically
placed in the mouse buffer. The text remains in the buffer
until you either delete it or perform another selection
function.
<P>
Once text has been selected, you can:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Paste the selected text to another location by
positioning the mouse pointer at the new
location and clicking the middle mouse button.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Delete the selected text by pressing the Delete
key or the Back Space key. (This operation
removes the text from the temporary mouse
buffer storage area.)
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Type over the selected text. (This operation also
removes the text from the temporary mouse
buffer storage area.)
<P>

</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>To place selected text into the temporary keyboard buffer
storage area, you must explicitly press either the
<B>Copy</B>
key or the Cut key. Once the text is in the keyboard
buffer, it remains the buffer until you either copy or cut
a different text selection into the buffer.
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Once you have placed selected text into the keyboard
buffer storage, you can paste it to another location by
positioning the cursor at the desired location and
pressing the Paste key.
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

environment, see the
<A HREF="">X User's Guide</A>.

<H2><A NAME="gDB1CfBrBM9X3cS">Using Drag-and-Drop</H2>

<P>
Drag-and-drop differs from cut-and-paste in that you can use the
drag-and-drop method to copy whole objects. For example, you
can click on a message from the message list and, by pressing
and holding the middle mouse button as you move the mouse,
you can drag the selected message(s) into the Composition
window. When you drop the message(s), by releasing the middle
mouse button, they are dropped into the text of the Composition
window at the spot where the mouse cursor is located. A message
you put into the Composition window this way appears as an
icon. The operation is similar to using the
<B>F</B><U>o</U><B>rward (encapsulate) ...</B>
option in the Main Window
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> menu. You can click on the
icon and a separate
<B>Edit</B> window will be opened so you can modify
the included message.
<P>
You can also use the drag-and-drop function to move
attachments around inside the Composition window.

<H2><A NAME="QAEI2.BsKL9X3cS">Adding Containers</H2>

<P>
You can add containers to your message, which allow you to
define structure, or hierarchy, for your message. MIME messages
can be defined recursively; they can contain components which
contain other components, which can be MIME messages
themselves.
<P>
You can add four kinds of containers:
<UL>
<LI>Mixed
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Message Digest
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Alternative
<P>

</LI>
<LI>Parallel
<P>

</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="BpJtg-BfiI9X3cS">See Also</H3>

<P>
For more information about containers, see
<A HREF="07C1CfBrBM9X3cS.html">Add Container
Option</A> and the help cards for the
<B>A</B><U>d</U><B>d Container</B> option in the
Composition window
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down menu.

<H2><A NAME="XAEI2.BsKL9X3cS">Adding Attachments</H2>

<P>
You can attach external data files to your message. This is one of
the most powerful features of a MIME message. The data in the
attachments can be plain text or various kinds of multimedia
data. The attachments can be included in the message or they
can be attached to the message with a pointer to their location.
Data included in the message can be represented with an icon or
expanded in-line.

<H3><A NAME="JpJtg-BfiI9X3cS">See Also</H3>

<P>
For more information about inclusions and attachments, see
<A HREF="bqbqgMBPQJ9X3cS.html">Include/Attach Option</A> and see the help cards for the
<U>I</U><B>nclude/Attach</B>
option in the Composition window
<U>M</U><B>essage</B> pull-down.

<H2><A NAME="8DLdWQBJqM9X3cS">Alternate Editor</H2>

<P>
You can
specify an
alternate editor with which to compose text.
When you exit from the alternate editor, your text is then placed
in the message compose field. See
<A HREF="XqbqgMBPQJ9X3cS.html">Alternate Text Editor Option</A>.
<P>
See the
<A HREF="XBFI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Composition Window Preferences</A> dialog for information
about specifying an alternate editor of your choice.

<H2><A NAME="jAEI2.BsKL9X3cS">Spelling Checker</H2>

<P>
You can use an external spelling checker command to verify the
spelling of your message. The default command used is
<CITE>ispell</CITE>.

<P>
For information about using the spelling checker, see
<A HREF="3GEI2.BsKL9X3cS.html">Spelling
Checker Option</A>. To use the spelling checker, click the
<B>Check
s</B><U>p</U><B>elling ...</B> button in the
<B>Message</B> pull down menu.
