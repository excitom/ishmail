<P>
You can specify these Reading window preferences:
<DL>
<DT><B>Number of columns</B>
<DD>Enter the number of columns you want the Reading
window to display. The default value is 80.
<P>

<DT><B>Number of header rows</B>
<DD>Enter the number of rows you want for displaying
headers from the mail message. The default value is 6. If
there are more headers than will fit in this area, a
vertical scroll bar is shown.
<P>
You can control whether all the message headers or only
a specific subset of message headers are shown in the
headers area (see
<A HREF="HeeSlNBpSL9X3cS.html">Show All Headers Option</A>). You can
also define which headers are in the subset shown using
the Main window (see
<A HREF="5MI1QLB-zWwA0YK.html">Displayed Headers Option</A>.
<P>

<DT><B>Number of body rows</B>
<DD>Enter the number of rows you want for displaying the
message body. The default value is 30. If there are more
headers than will fit in this area, a vertical scroll bar is
shown.
<P>

<DT><B>View type</B>
<DD>When reading a MIME message you can view it in
<I>Outline</I> form or
<I>Flat</I> form. Chose which form you want by
clicking one of the
<B>View type:</B> radio buttons. These buttons
have no effect on an ordinary mail message.
<P>
You can set the default type here, or override the default
on a per message basis by clicking the
<B>View type:</B> radio
buttons in the Reading window.
<P>
In Outline form you can easily see the message structure,
including nesting of parts, if any. Each part is labelled
with a description of its contents. You can click on any of
the parts and see it expanded.
<P>
If you choose Flat form to view a message all the plain
text and enriched text parts are expanded, or
<I>flattened</I>.
The overall structure of the message will not be as
apparent, instead it will read like a document rather
than its table of contents.
<P>
In the Flat view, message parts containing data other
than text will appear as icons. The icon will represent the
data type, and will be labeled with a short description of
the data. Just as with the Outline view, click an icon and
the appropriate view program will be launched.
<P>

<DT><B>Wrap text at right margin</B>
<DD>Click the
<B>Wrap text at right margin</B> button to cause text to wrap
if it exceeds the specified column width. If you don't
choose the wrap option, a horizontal scroll bar is shown
for lines which exceed the specified
<B>Number of columns</B>.
<P>
